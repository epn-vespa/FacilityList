			<Description>Christchurch station is located in Christchurch, South Island, New Zealand. It has been in operation from October 1937. The Physics and Astronomy Department of the Univsersity of Canterbury used to operate an ionosonde at both Eyrewell (about 30km northwest of Christchurch ) and at Scott Base in the Antarctic. The ionosonde programme was taken over by the Department after the disestablishment of the DSIR in the late 1980&#x2019;s.  

			Unfortunately the LandCorp site at Eyrewell was converted to a large diary farm in early 2014 shortly after the instrument had been replaced with a state of the art CADI system. Once a new site is secured it is envisaged that New Zealand will again have a ground based method of detemining the local ionospheric conditions essential for some remote search and rescue missions. Currently the closest ionosonde is in Australia leaving all of NZ, and it's vast surrounding oceans reliant on model output.

			An ionosonde is a swept frequency vertical sounding radar. The time delay of the echoes from the ionosphere give information on the electron density in the ionosphere. The ionogram (picture produced by an ionosonde) displays the time to receipt of an echo on the vertical axis against frequency on the horizontal axis. Ionograms are recorded typically every 5 minutes for good temporal resolution.

			Ionosondes are operated at several locations by SWN in Australia. SWS, a unit of the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology, provides the Australian radio propagation and space environment services.   Current and recent  ionograms for all automated sites may be viewed using the Java applet provided on the SWN site. Data archives on film dating from the earliest ionosonde in 1938 until the early 1990&#x2019;s are held at the New Zealand Film Archives unit. 

			The remaining Scott Base ionosonde is maintained under an SWS contract to the Department of Physics.

         <Description>The Christchurch Ionosonde station near Christchurch, New Zealand, had ionosondes since August of 1942. According to INAG-4 and INAG-38, in 1969, a N.Z. P2 ionosonde was operated with 1.0-22.00 MHz frequency range, and from I January 1983, an IPS-42 ionosonde would be operating at Eyrewell 43° 25.2' S, 172° 20.3' E. Eyrewell Forest is a small rural area in the Waimakariri District, New Zealand, close to Christchurch, in 50 km. The ionograms from this site will be scaled to produce the published data. There was an IPS 4D between 08/1994 and 10/2011, a CADI between 01/2014 and 04/2014, and an IPS 5D since 05/2012 to 01/2014. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally swept in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.</Description>
