      <Description>The purpose of the AE-D mission was to continue the investigation begun by AE-C of the chemical processes and energy transfer mechanisms that control the structure and behavior of the earth's atmosphere and ionosphere in the region of high absorption of solar energy. This mission was planned to sample the high latitude regions at the same time that the AE-E mission was sampling the equatorial and low latitude regions. The same type of spacecraft as AE-C was used, and the payload consisted of the same types of instruments except for deletion of the extreme solar UV monitor and the Bennett ion mass spectrometer, which were part of the AE-E payload. The polar orbit provided the sampling of all latitudes and the perigee moved through all latitudes in 3 months and all local times in 4 months. Unfortunately, a failure in the solar power panels resulted in the termination of operations on January 29, 1976, after slightly less than 4 months of useful life. However, all the regions at the perigee altitudes were sampled during this time. The spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere about 1 month after cessation of telemetry. To continue the correlated observations with the AE-E mission, AE-C was reactivated on February 28, 1976, to replace AE-D. More details can be found in A. Dalgarno et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 263, 1973.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment provided direct measurements of the energy input into the upper
   atmosphere due to electrons and protons in the energy range of 0.2 to 25 keV. The experiment
   acquired differential measurements of the energy influx and angular distribution. There were
   two detectors measuring electrons and protons from 0.2 to 25 keV in 16 logarithmically spaced
   steps, and one detector measuring 5 keV electrons continuously. Each detector consisted of a
   cylindrical electrostatic analyzer for species and energy selection, and a Spiraltron electron
   multiplier for particle detection. Energy distributions were obtained by applying different
   fixed or stepped voltages to the deflection plates. Distributions in angle were measured using
   the spacecraft spin and the analyzers' positions on the spacecraft. In the despun modes,
   measurements were obtained at 45 deg to the spacecraft equator, and radially away from the
   earth. Detector look angles were chosen to give optimum magnetic pitch-angle coverage when the
   spacecraft was moving either poleward or equatorward. All detectors were identical in construction
   and used 1- x 6-mm entrance apertures. Counts were accumulated over 55.7 ms and read out each
   main telemetry frame (62.5 ms). The two stepped detectors moved one energy step once each main
   frame with the same accumulation time, requiring about 1 s for a complete cycle of steps. More
   complete details of this experiment may be found in

      <Description>The CEP consisted of two identical instruments designed to measure electron
   temperatures, electron and ion concentrations, ion mass, and spacecraft potential. One probe
   was oriented along the spin axis of the spacecraft (normally perpendicular to the orbit plane),
   and the other radially so that it could observe in the direction of the velocity vector once
   each 15-s spin period. Each instrument was a retarding potential Langmuir probe device that
   produced a current-voltage (I-V) curve for a known voltage pattern placed on the collector.
   Electrometers were used to measure the current. There were two systems of operation (one with
   two modes and another with three modes) using collector voltage patterns between plus and minus
   5 volts. Most modes involved an automatic or fixed adjustment of collector voltage limits
   (and/or electrometer output) such that the region of interest on the I-V profile provided
   high resolution. Each system was designed for use with only one of the probes, but they
   could be interswitched to provide backup redundancy. The best measurements in the most
   favorable modes provided one-second time resolution; electron temperature between 300 and
   1.E4 deg K (10% accuracy); ion density between 1.E4 and 1.E7 ions/cc (10-20% accuracy);
   electron density between 50 and 1.E6 electrons/cc; and ion mass at ion densities above 1.E4
   ions/cc. Each probe had a collector electrode extending from the central axis of a
   cylindrical guard ring. The 2.5-cm-long guard ring was at the end of a 25-cm boom, and the
   collector extended another 7.5 cm beyond the guard ring. The boom, guard, and collector
   were 0.2 cm in diameter. More detailed information can be found in L. H. Brace et al.,
   Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 341, 1973. NSSDC has all the useful data that exist from this

      <Description>The Miniature Electrostatic Analyzer (MESA) obtained data on the neutral density
   of the atmosphere in the altitude range of 120 to 400 km by the measurements of satellite
   deceleration due to aerodynamic drag. The instrument consisted of three single-axis
   accelerometers, mounted mutually at right angles, two in the spacecraft X-Y plane and the other
   in the Z-axis. The instrument determined the applied acceleration from the electrostatic force
   required to recenter a proof mass. The output of the device was a digital pulse rate proportional
   to the applied acceleration. The sample time of each measurement was 0.25 s. The measurements
   allowed determination of the density of the neutral atmosphere, monitored the thrust of the
   orbit-adjust propulsion system (OAPS), determined the satellite minimum altitude, measured
   spacecraft roll, and provided some attitude-sensing information. Spacecraft nutations of less
   than 0.01 deg were monitored. The instrument had three sensitivity ranges: 8.E-3 earth's
   gravity (G) in OAPS monitor mode; 4.E-4 G between 120 km (plus or minus 2%) and 280 km
   (plus or minus 10%); and 2.E-5 G between 180 km (plus or minus 2%) and 400 km (plus or
   minus 10%). Numbers in parentheses represent errors. A systematic error of up to plus or
   minus 5% due to drag coefficient uncertainty was also possible. The highest measurement
   altitude was determined assuming the instrument could sense to 0.2% of full scale. More
   details can be found in K. S. W. Champion et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 297, 1973.

      <Description>The visible airglow experiment provided volume emission rates for several dayglow,
   nightglow, and auroral optical emission features. A photometer containing two separate optical channels
   was used. Spectral selection was accomplished with a common filter wheel that contained six interference
   filters and a dark and calibrate position. The wavelengths measured in pairs (in Angstroms) were 7319
   and 4861, 5200 and dark, 5577 and 7319, 4278 and 5200, 6300 and 5577, calibration and 4278, and 4861
   and 6300. The two channels were separated in angle by 90 deg. One channel had a large field of view
   (3 deg half-angle) for high sensitivity, normally pointing toward the local zenith, and the second
   channel had a small field of view (0.75 deg half-angle) for high spatial resolution, pointing tangent
   to the surface of the earth when the satellite was in the despun mode. Both channels were protected from
   stray light contamination during daytime by multistage baffle systems. Photons that had been spectrally
   and spatially selected were sensed by a pulse-counting photomultiplier system capable of counting at a
   rate of 5.E6 counts/s. The filters could be operated in several modes, e.g., fixed filter, and
   automatic filter changes could be synchronized either to satellite orientation or to a fixed-time
   base. More experiment details can be found in P. B. Hays et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 369, 1973.

      <Description>This experiment was designed to determine vector ion drift velocities, ion concentration
   and temperature, and spacecraft potential. An ionospheric irregularity index was also obtained from
   the ion concentration sensor. The experiment consisted of a retarding potential analyzer with four
   planar sensor heads. The sensor head used for ion drift measurements was co-located with another head,
   and all heads were spaced almost equally, looking outward from the satellite equator. Since the
   satellite spin axis was perpendicular to the orbit plane, these heads could observe along the spacecraft
   velocity vector in either the spin or despun mode of the spacecraft. The primary purpose of this
   experiment was to provide accurate ion temperatures with other measurements being of secondary importance.
   Three of the sensor heads were similar: they had two grounded entrance grids, two retarding grids, a
   suppressor grid, a shield grid, and a collector. A linear sweep voltage (32 or 22 to 0 V, up or down)
   was normally applied to the retarding grids in 0.75 s. Interpretation of the resulting current-voltage
   profiles provided the ion temperature, the ion and electron concentration, some ion composition
   information, vehicle potential and plasma drift velocity parallel to the velocity vector. Two of
   the three similar sensors had an additional grid between the entrance and retarding grids in order
   to protect inner grids from ion bombardment during electron measurements. The other significant
   feature of these two sensors was that a small positive collector bias could be applied to assure
   adequate access of thermal electrons to the collector. With the retarding grid at constant zero volts,
   current changes could be observed for 3-s periods to obtain gradients of ion concentration.
   Electron parameters were measured in a manner similar to ions. Ions in mass ranges 1 to 4, 14 to 16,
   24 to 32 and greater than 40 atomic mass units could be identified. The fourth sensor head was for
   the ion-drift velocity measurements, and consisted of four grounded grids, a negatively biased
   suppressor grid, and a 4-segment collector. Differences in various collector segment currents provided
   ion-drift directional component information. More details of this experiment are available in W. B.

      <ReleaseDate>2019-05-05T12:34:56Z</ReleaseDate>
      <Description>This Ultraviolet Nitric-Oxide Experiment (UVNO) consisted of a two-channel fixed-grating
   Ebert-Fastie spectrometer, which measured the airglow in the (1, 0) Gamma band in a 15-A region
   centered at 2149 A. The observed intensity was produced by resonance fluorescence of sunlight by
   the nitric-oxide molecules in the instrument's field of view. The intensity data obtained yielded
   altitude profiles of nitric-oxide density as a function of time and location. The remote sensing
   character of the UVNO experiment permitted measurements of nitric-oxide to be made at altitudes both
   above and below satellite perigee. As the spacecraft spun, the spectrometer, which looked outward
   through the rim of the satellite, repeatedly had its field of view carried down through the atmosphere
   onto the earth's limb, and altitude profiles of the emitted airglow intensity were obtained.
   Below some altitude the measured signal at 2149 A was contaminated by rayleigh-scattered sunlight. To
   correct for this contamination, a second channel measured only scattered light intensity in a 12-A
   region centered at 2190 A. The two channels were optically and electrically independent. Nitric-oxide
   airglow intensity was determined by taking the difference between these two measurements. The
   sensor's spherical fused-quartz telescope mirror had a 125-mm focal length, and focused incident
   light on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. From this slit the light struck one-half of the mirror
   and was collimated onto the grating. The 3600-lines-per-mm grating returned the light collimated
   to the other half of the mirror, and the light was focused on two exit slits. The spectrometer field
   of view was 4 deg X 1/4 deg, with the long axis parallel to the spacecraft's spin axis, and therefore
   parallel to the viewed limb. In normal operation each channel was integrated for 20.8 ms and read out
   alternately at 10.4-ms intervals. The instrument was protected against contamination from internal
   scattering of off-axis undispersed light. More experiment details can be found in C. A. Barth et al.,
   Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 379, 1973. NSSDC has all the useful data that exist from this investigation.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment was designed to provide information on the intensity, angular distribution,
   energy spectrum, and net flows along field lines, of electrons in the thermosphere with energies between
   1 and 500 eV. The instrument consisted of two identical oppositely directed hemispherical electrostatic
   analyzers, and it had 30 operating modes. Each spectrometer had a relative energy resolution plus or
   minus 2.5% and a geometric factor on the order of 0.001 sq cm sr, independent of electron energy.
   Three separate energy ranges could be sensed: 0 to 25, 0 to 100, or 0 to 500 eV. Measurements from
   these intervals could be sequenced in 5 different ways. Data could be taken from either sensor
   separately, or alternately with time resolution varying from 0.25 to 8 s. There were two deflection
   voltage scan rates determined by spacecraft clock. This voltage was changed in 64 steps, and was done
   at 4 or 16 steps per telemetry frame. With 16 frames/s, this allowed a choice of either one 64-point
   spectrum, or four 16-point spectra in 1 s. The longest (8 s) cycle of data involved observations using
   increasing voltage steps for the lowest, middle, lowest, then highest energy ranges (in that order)
   for 1 s each. A repeat for decreasing voltage steps completed the cycle. A more detailed description
   of this experiment may be found in J. P. Doering et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 387, 1973.

      <Description>The objective of this experiment was to contribute to a study of the chemical, dynamic, and
   energetic processes that control the structure of the thermosphere by providing direct, in situ
   measurements of both major and minor neutral atmospheric constituents having masses in the range from
   1 to 48 atomic mass units (u). A double-focusing Mattauch-Herzog magnetic deflection mass spectrometer
   with an impact ion source was flown. Two ion collectors were included to measure ions differing in mass
   by a factor of 8, i.e., the two mass ranges covered were 1 to 6 u and 6 to 48 u. In the ion source the
   neutral species were ionized by means of electron impact. At altitudes greater than 380 km, ion currents
   were measured with an electron multiplier counting individual ions. Counts were accumulated for 1/20 s
   before automatically switching to a different mass number. While complete mass spectra could be swept,
   in the common mode of operation peak stepping was employed, with readings on the principal peaks in the
   mass spectrum being repeated approximately every 0.5 s and on other species less frequently. Data below
   380 km were measured using an electrometer. In addition to the peak-stepping mode, there were several
   other operating modes which were selected by ground command. In the fly-through mode, the ion source
   voltages were adjusted so that there was no electric field to draw ions out of the electron beam when
   they were formed. Ambient particles striking the ion source retained energies less than 0.1 eV, which
   is not high enough to overcome the negative space charge potential holding the ions in the beam. Those
   ambient particles that did not strike the ion source retained their incoming energy of several eV after
   ionization and escaped into the accelerating region of the analyzer. The electron accelerating potential
   was 75 eV in normal mode operation and 25 eV in the fly-through mode. In another operating mode, the
   instrument switched automatically to a sequence of masses of particular interest such as, e.g.,
   between masses 16 and 32 or between masses 28 and 32. More experiment details can be found in A. O.

      <Description>This experiment measured in situ the spatial distribution and temporal changes of the
   concentrations of the neutral atmospheric species. In addition, new insight into in situ measurement
   techniques was obtained from comparisons of these measurements with other onboard experiments:
   namely, open-source spectrometer (75-096A-07), solar EUV spectrophotometer (75-096A-06), and
   density accelerometer (75-096A-02). The mass-spectrometer sensor included a gold-plated stainless
   steel thermalizing chamber and ion source, a hyperbolic-rod quadrupole analyzer, and an off-axis
   electron multiplier. Five different sequences of mass selection were available and, expressed in
   atomic mass units (u), were as follows: (1) geophysical -1, 2, 4, total, 16, 28, 32, selected,
   40, (2) analytical -12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 30, 44, calibrate, zero, (3) individual -selected,
   selected, selected, ... (any mass 1 to 44), (4) sweep digital -1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... 45 (in 3/16-u steps),
   (5) sweep analog 2, 3, 4, 5, ... 45 (continuous). Five operational formats were available and
   selected by ground command. When operating in the "normal" format, the analyzer measured all
   masses in the range 1 to 44 with emphasis on hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and argon.
   Another format was optimized for minor constituent studies of any individual gas species in
   the measured range. Spatial resolution was determined primarily by the mode of spacecraft operation.
   In orbit, the presealed spectrometer was opened, and the atmospheric constituents passed through
   a knife-edged orifice into the thermalization chamber and ion source. Selected ions left the
   quadrupole analyzer through a weak focusing lens and were accelerated into a 14-stage electron
   multiplier, where they were turned 90 deg to strike the first dynode. For each impacting ion,
   the multiplier output was a pulse of 2.E6 electrons. These output pulses constituted the
   measurement and the count rate was proportional to the chamber density of the selected species.
   These density values were converted to ambient concentrations. The analyzer normally operated at
   a resolution of 1 u over the mass range, so that a mass peak one-thousandth the amplitude of an
   adjacent peak could be measured. For the dynamic range required, pulses occurring during 0.015-s
   integration intervals were accumulated in a 16-bit counter. Multiple integration periods (up to 16)
   were assigned to each measurement for less dense atmospheric species. Automatically selected ranges
   of ionizing electron currents were used. The overall range of the measurements was planned to be
   greater than 1.E7. There was a provision for the instrument orifice to be covered during spacecraft
   thruster operations. More experiment details can be found in D. T. Pelz et al.,
   Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 277, 1973. NSSDC has all the useful data that exist from this investigation.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment was designed to measure the kinetic temperature of the neutral atmosphere by
   determining the instantaneous density of molecular nitrogen in a spherical chamber coupled to the
   atmosphere through a knife-edge orifice. Analysis of the measured molecular nitrogen density variation
   over a spin cycle with a knowledge of the satellite's motion and orientation led to a determination of
   the ambient temperature, independent of scale height. The NATE also provided measurements of the neutral
   composition, when commanded into the appropriate mode. In addition, values for the zonal wind were
   obtained, from measurement of the "stream" position relative to the satellite velocity. An alternate
   measurement of neutral temperature also was undertaken, using a baffle inserted in front of the orifice
   to intercept a portion of the gas particle stream entering the chamber. When the satellite was in the
   despun mode, the baffle was made to oscillate in the stepwise fashion in order to interrupt the particle
   stream seen by the orificed chamber. These chamber density variations were interpreted to yield the
   neutral gas kinetic temperature also. A dual-filament ion source sampled the thermalized molecular
   nitrogen in the chamber and produced an ion beam density proportional to the nitrogen chamber density.
   From the source, the ionized beam was directed to a quadrupole analyzer, tuned to pass those particles
   whose mass-to-charge ratio (M/Q) was 28. This ionized nitrogen beam then passed on to an electron
   multiplier. The output pulses were amplified and counted in a 16-bit accumulator. The sensor was
   vacuum-sealed prior to launch and opened to the atmosphere after the spacecraft was in orbit. More
   experiment details can be found in N. W. Spencer et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 287, 1973. NSSDC

      <Description>A magnetic ion-mass spectrometer was flown to measure in situ the concentrations of
   the ambient positive ion species in the mass range from 1 to 90 atomic mass units (u). Mounted on
   the satellite equator normal to the spin axis, the entrance aperture faced forward when the
   spacecraft was in the despun mode. The electric and magnetic fields were arranged to produce
   a mass spectrum along the focal plane following the magnetic analyzer. Three slits were placed
   along this plane in appropriate places to simultaneously collect ions in the mass ratio 1-4-16.
   Ionospheric ions were accelerated into the analyzer system by a negative voltage that varied
   from -1060 to -225 V. The three mass ranges measured simultaneously were 1 to 4, 4 to 16,
   and 14 to 72 u. Following each slit was an electron multiplier and logarithmic
   electrometer-amplifier detector. The detector output was either measured directly for an analog
   output, or was supplied to a "peak" circuit that determined the amplitude of each peak in the
   spectrum. Only the amplitude of each peak was telemetered in the "peak" mode, and in this mode
   the time required to simultaneously sweep all three mass ranges was 1 s. Other modes of
   operation were possible. In the analog short mode, the three mass ranges were swept in 2 s,
   alternating with 1-s "peak" mode scans. An 8-s sweep time was required in the analog long mode,
   again alternating with 1-s "peak" mode scans. An option existed in the locked mode to
   continuously measure any set of mass numbers in the ratio 1-4-16 to give high spatial resolution.
