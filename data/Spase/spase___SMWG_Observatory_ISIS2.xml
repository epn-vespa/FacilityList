      <Description>ISIS 2 was an ionospheric observatory instrumented with a sweep- and a fixed-frequency ionosonde, a VLF receiver, energetic and soft particle detectors, an ion mass spectrometer, an electrostatic probe, a retarding potential analyzer, a beacon transmitter, a cosmic noise experiment, and two photometers. Two long crossed-dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m) were used for the sounding, VLF, and cosmic noise experiments. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized to about 2 rpm after antenna deployment. There were two basic orientation modes for the spacecraft, cartwheel and orbit-aligned. The spacecraft operated approximately the same length of time in each mode, remaining in one mode typically 3 to 5 months. The cartwheel mode with the axis perpendicular to the orbit plane was made available to provide ram and wake data for some experiments for each spin period, rather than for each orbit period. Attitude and spin information was obtained from a three-axis magnetometer and a sun sensor. Control of attitude and spin was possible by means of magnetic torquing. The experiment package also included a programmable tape recorder with a 1-h capacity. For nonrecorded observations, data from satellite and subsatellite regions were telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of sight of a telemetry station. Telemetry stations were located so that primary data coverage was near the 80-deg-W meridian and near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, England, France, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Central Africa. NASA support of the ISIS project was terminated on October 1, 1979. A significant amount of experimental data, however, was acquired after this date by the Canadian project team. ISIS 2 operations were terminated in Canada on March 9, 1984. The Radio Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) then requested and received permission to reactivate ISIS 2. Regular ISIS 2 operations were started from Kashima, Japan, in early August 1984. ISIS 2 was deactivated effective 24, 1990. A data restoration effort began in the late ninties and successfully saved a considerable portion of the high-resolution data before the telemetry tapes were discarted.

      <Description>The ISIS 2 (International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies) magnetic ion-mass spectrometer experiment measured the distribution of positive ion species as a function of time and position, with a particular focus on polar wind particles. The instrument had two ion detector systems, and mass scanning through the range from 1 to 64 atomic mass units (u) was accomplished in two sections, 1 to 8 u and 8 to 64 u. Two ion beams emerged from the magnetic sector of the instrument and were simultaneously detected by electron multipliers and log electrometer amplifiers. A circuit following each amplifier detected the peak amplitude of the ion current. That peak value, rather than the entire mass spectrum, was transmitted in order to reduce the required telemetry bandwidth. In that mode of operation, the complete mass range was scanned in 1 s. A backup mode was provided that produced an analog output with a sweep period of 8 s. This experiment operated nominally after launch with most of the data obtained in the peak mode and while the satellite operated in the cartwheel mode. For about 2 min per pass over Ottawa, Canada, the experiment operated in the analog mode. Inflight calibration was achieved by comparing ion concentration measurements at appropriate altitudes, i.e., where a single ion species predominated, with electron density data from the sounder on board. Other comparisons were made between the spectrometer output and measurements obtained from other related experiments on board.</Description>

      <Description>The purpose of this experiment was to study the global variations of electron temperature and electron concentration at spacecraft altitudes during the waning phase of the solar cycle. The measurements were made with two cylindrical probes mounted along the spin axis, one at each end of the spacecraft. The sensors were operated as Langmuir probes, with the probe current being measured as a function of probe voltage. Although basically the same cylindrical probe experiment was flown on ISIS 1, the ISIS 2 probe provided (1) greater sensitivity allowing a more complete coverage of low-density regions such as the region over the polar cap, (2) very high resolution of plasma structure (down to 10 m in extent), and (3) onboard signal processing with backup to provide data in the format that had been used for the ISIS 1 experiment. NSSDC has all the useful data that exist from this investigation.</Description>

      <ReleaseDate>2019-05-05T12:34:56Z</ReleaseDate>
      <Description>The ISIS 2 (International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies) Swept-Frequency Sounder measured the ionospheric electron density in the altitude range 300 to 1400 km, and provided  correlative data for the other ISIS 2 experiments, particularly those measuring ionospheric parameters. The ionosonde was a radio transmitter that recorded the time delay between a transmitted and returned radio-frequency pulse. A continuum of frequencies between 0.1 and 20 MHz was sampled every 14 or 21 s, and one of six selected frequencies was also used for sounding for a few seconds during each 14- or 21-s period. In addition to the sweep- and fixed-frequency modes of operation, a mixed mode was available in which the transmitter frequency was fixed at one of six possible frequencies while the receiver swept. Several virtual-range (delay-time) traces resulting from ground reflections, plasma resonances, birefringence of the ionosphere, nonvertical propagation, etc., were normally observed.</Description>

      <ReleaseDate>2019-05-05T12:34:56Z</ReleaseDate>
      <Description>The ISIS 2 (International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies) Fixed-Frequency Sounder was designed to study ionospheric features of a smaller scale than could be detected by the sweep sounder and to study plasma resonances. Parameters measured were virtual range (a function of propagation time of the pulse) and time. These data were normally observed only when the spacecraft was in range of a telemetry station. The fixed-frequency sounder operated from the same antenna, transmitter, and receiver used for the sweep-frequency experiment. It normally operated for 3 to 5 s during the frequency flyback period of the sweep-frequency operation which was every 14 or 21 s. One of six frequencies (0.12, 0.48, 1.00, 1.95, 4.00, or 9.303 MHz) was chosen for use by the experimenter, as desired. Other modes of operation were available, including continuous observation at a selected frequency and a special mixed mode with transmission at a selected one of the six fixed frequencies and sweep reception.</Description>
