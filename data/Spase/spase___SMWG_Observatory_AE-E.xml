      <Description>The purpose of the AE-E mission was to investigate the chemical processes and energy transfer mechanisms that control the structure and behavior of the earth's atmosphere and ionosphere in the region of high absorption of solar energy at low and equatorial latitudes. The simultaneous sampling at higher latitudes was carried out by the AE-D spacecraft until its failure on January 29, 1976, and then by AE-C, until it reentered on December 12, 1978. The same type of spacecraft as AE-C was used, and the payload consisted of the same types of instruments except that the low-energy electron and UV nitric oxide experiments were deleted and a backscatter UV spectrometer was added to monitor the ozone content of the atmosphere. The two experiments that were deleted were more appropriate for the high-latitude regions. The perigee swept through more than six full latitude cycles and two local time cycles during the first year after launch when the orbit was elliptical and the perigee height was varied between 130 and 400 km. The circularization of the orbit around 390 km was made on November 20, 1976 and the spacecraft was raised to this height whenever it would decay to about 250 km. AE-E reentered on June 10, 1981.

      <Description>The objective of this experiment was to contribute to a study of the chemical, dynamic,
   and energetic processes that control the structure of the thermosphere by providing direct in situ
   measurements of both major and minor neutral atmospheric constituents having masses in the range
   from 1 to 48 atomic mass units (u). A double-focusing, Mattauch-Herzog magnetic deflection mass
   spectrometer with an impact ion source was flown. Two ion collectors were included to measure ions
   differing in mass by a factor of 8; i.e., the two mass ranges covered were 1 to 6 and 6 to 48 u.
   In the ion source the neutral species were ionized by means of electron impact. The electron energies
   were selectable; 75 eV for the high-eV mode and 25 eV for the low-eV mode. At altitudes greater
   than 380 km, ion currents were measured with an electron multiplier. Counts were accumulated for
   1/20 s before automatically switching to a different mass number. While complete mass spectra could
   be swept, in the common mode of operation peak stepping was employed; readings on principal peaks in
   the mass spectrum were repeated approximately every 0.5 s and on other species less frequently.
   Data below 380 km were measured using an electrometer. In addition to the peak stepping mode,
   there were several other operating modes which were selected by ground command. In the fly-through
   mode, ambient particles striking the ion source retained energies less than 0.1 eV, which was not
   high enough to overcome the negative space charge potential holding the ions in the beam. Those
   ambient particles that did not strike the ion source retained their incoming energy of several eV
   after ionization and escaped into the acceleration region of the analyzer. More experiment details
   can be found in A. O. Nier et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 271, 1973.</Description>

      <Description>The Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUVS) was used to observe the variations in
   the solar EUV flux in the wavelength range from 140 to 1850 A and the atmospheric attenuation
   at various fixed wavelengths. This provided quantitative atmospheric structure and composition
   data. The instrument consisted of 24 grazing-incidence grating monochromators, using parallel-slit
   systems for entrance collimation and photoelectric detectors at the exit slits. Twelve of these
   monochromators had wavelength scan capability, each with 128 selectable wavelength positions,
   which could also automatically step scan through these positions. The other 12 monochromators
   operated at fixed wavelengths with fields of view smaller than the full solar disk to aid in the
   atmospheric absorption analysis. The spectral resolution varied from 2 to 54 A depending upon
   the particular instrument. The field of view varied from 60 x 60 down to 3 x 6 arc min. All 24
   monochromator-entrance axes were co-aligned parallel. A solar pointing system could point to 256
   different positions, execute a 16-step one-dimensional scan or a full 256-step raster. The time
   resolution varied from 0.5 s for observing 12 fixed wavelengths up to 256 s for programming the
   EUVS through all possible modes. More details can be found in H. E. Hinteregger et al.,

      <Description>This experiment measured in situ the spatial distribution and temporal changes of the
   concentrations of the neutral atmospheric species. In addition, new insight into in situ measurement
   techniques was obtained from comparisons of these measurements with those obtained from other onboard
   experiments; namely, open source spectrometer (75-107A-07), solar EUV spectrometer (75-107A-06), and
   atmospheric density accelerometer (75-107A-02). The mass-spectrometer sensor had a gold-plated stainless
   steel thermalizing chamber and ion source, a hyperbolic rod quadrupole analyzer, and an off-axis
   electron multiplier. When operating in the "normal" format, the analyzer measured all masses in the
   range 1 to 44 atomic mass units with emphasis on hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and argon.
   Another format was optimized for minor constituent studies of gas species in the measured range.
   Spatial resolution was determined primarily by the mode of spacecraft operation. In orbit, the presealed
   spectrometer was opened, and the atmospheric constituents passed through a knife-edged orifice into the
   thermalization chamber and ion source. Selected ions left the quadrupole analyzer through a weak
   focusing lens and were accelerated into an electron multiplier, where they were turned 90 deg to
   strike the first dynode. The spectrometer had a resolution of better than 1 u for all masses between
   1 and 44, and the measurement system had a planned dynamic range of approximately 1.E8. There was
   provision for the instrument orifice to be covered during spacecraft thruster operations. More
   experiment details can be found in D. T. Pelz et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 277, 1973.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment was designed to measure the kinetic temperature of the neutral atmosphere by
   determining the instantaneous density of molecular nitrogen in a spherical chamber coupled to the
   atmosphere through a knife-edged orifice. Analysis of the measured molecular nitrogen density variation
   over a spin cycle with a knowledge of the satellite's motion and orientation led to a determination
   of the ambient temperature, independent of scale height. Measurements of the ambient neutral composition
   were obtained when the instrument was commanded into the appropriate mode. Approximate values for the
   meridional wind were obtained from the measurement of the "stream" position relative to the satellite
   velocity. An alternate measurement of neutral temperature was also undertaken, using a baffle inserted
   in front of the orifice to intercept a portion of the gas particle stream entering the chamber. When the
   satellite was in the despun mode, the baffle was made to oscillate in a stepwise fashion in order to
   interrupt the particle stream seen by the orificed chamber. These chamber density variations were
   interpreted to yield the neutral gas kinetic temperature too. A dual-filament ion source sampled the
   thermalized molecular nitrogen in the chamber and produced an ion beam density proportional to the
   nitrogen chamber density. From the source, this ionized nitrogen beam was directed into a quadrupole
   analyzer, tuned to pass those particles with a mass-to-charge ratio of 28. The beam then struck an
   electron multiplier, and the output pulses were amplified and counted. The sensor was vacuum-sealed prior
   to launch and opened to the atmosphere after the spacecraft was in orbit. More experiment details can
   be found in N. W. Spencer et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 287, 1973.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment provided detailed data on the rates of excitation of the atomic and
   molecular constituents of the thermosphere. The wavelength range, expressed in Angstroms, was measured
   in pairs: 7319 and 6563, 5300 and dark, 5577 and 7319, 2800 and 5200, 6300 and 5577, calibrate and
   2800, and 6563 and 6300. A photometer was used which contained two separate optical channels, a narrow
   field of view and a wide field of view. Spectral selection was accomplished with a filter wheel that
   contained six interference filters and a dark and calibrate position. The two channels were separated
   by 90 deg. One channel had a 3-deg half-angle cone field of view for high sensitivity and pointed
   normally toward the local zenith. The second had a field of view of 0.75-deg half cone for high spatial
   resolution, pointing tangentially to the surface of the earth when the satellite was in the oriented
   mode. Both channels were protected from stray light contamination during the daytime with multistage
   baffle systems. Filters were operated in several modes. The two separate optical channels were monitored
   at time intervals consistent with their angular resolution in the spinning mode. More experiment details

      <Description>The backscatter ultraviolet instrument (BUV) monitored
the spatial distribution of atmospheric ozone by measuring the intensity
of the UV radiation backscattered from the earth's atmosphere. To obtain
this ozone distribution, the BUV subsystem measured direct solar radiation
and backscattered UV radiation from the daytime sun-illuminated atmosphere.
The instrument consisted of a spectrometer (monochromator) and a photometer.
The monochromator measured the intensity of UV radiation backscatter and
reflected radiation from the earth's atmosphere in 12 wavelengths (2555
to 3398 A) in which ozone attenuation occurs. The photometer measured the
reflected UV radiation in a single wavelength span in which attenuation by
ozone does not occur.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment was flown to measure, throughout the orbit, the individual concentrations of
   all thermal ion species in the mass range 1 to 72 atomic mass units (u) and in the ambient density range
   from 5 to 5.E6 ions/cc. The mass range was normally scanned in 1.7 s, but the scan time per range could
   be increased by command. Laboratory and inflight determination of spectrometer efficiency and mass
   discrimination permitted direct conversion of measured ion currents to ambient concentrations. Correlation
   of these measured data with the results from companion experiments, CEP (75-107A-01) and RPA (75-107A-04)
   permitted individual ion concentrations to be determined with high accuracy. The experiment's four
   primary mechanical components were guard ring and ion-analyzer tube, collector and preamplifier assembly,
   vent, and main electronics housing. A three-stage Bennett tube with 7- to 5-cycle drift spaces was
   flown; it was modified to permit ion concentration measurements to be obtained at low altitudes.
   The balance between ion-current sensitivity and mass resolution in a Bennett spectrometer may be altered
   by changing appropriate voltages. These voltage changes were controlled independently by ground command
   for each one of the three mass ranges: 1 to 4, 2 to 18, and 8 to 72. More complete experiment details
   can be found in H. C. Brinton et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 369, 1973.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment was designed to provide information on the intensity, angular distribution,
   energy spectrum, and net flow along field lines, of electrons in the thermosphere with energies between
   1 and 500 eV. The instrument consisted of two identical oppositely directed hemispherical electrostatic
   analyzers, and contained 30 operating modes. Each spectrometer had a relative energy resolution of plus
   or minus 2.5% and a geometric factor on the order of 0.001 sq cm-sr, independent of electron energy.
   Three separate energy ranges could be measured: 0 to 25, 0 to 100, and 0 to 500 eV. Measurements from
   these intervals could be sequenced in five different ways. Data could be taken from either sensor
   separately, or alternately with time resolution varying from 0.25 to 8 s. There were two deflection
   voltage scan rates determined by the spacecraft clock. This voltage was changed in 64 steps, and was
   done at 4 or 16 steps per telemetry frame. With 16 frames/s, this allowed a choice of either one
   64-point spectrum, or four 16-point spectra in one second. The longest (8 s) cycle of data involved
   observations using increasing voltage steps for the lowest, middle, lowest, then highest energy ranges
   (in that order) for 1 s each. A repeat for decreasing voltage steps completed the cycle. A more
   detailed description of this experiment is found in J. P. Doering et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p.
   387, 1973.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment was designed to determine vector ion drift velocities, ion concentration
   and temperature, total ion concentration roughness, and spacecraft potential. The experiment consisted
   of a retarding potential analyzer with four planar sensor heads. The sensor heads were spaced nearly
   equally around the satellite equator. Since the satellite spin axis was perpendicular to the orbit plane,
   these heads could observe along the spacecraft velocity vector in either the spin or despun mode of
   the spacecraft. Three of the sensor heads were similar. They had two grounded entrance grids, two
   retarding grids, a suppressor grid, a shield grid, and a collector. A linear sweep voltage (32 or 22
   to 0 V, up or down) was normally applied to the retarding grids in 0.75 s. Interpretation of the
   resulting current-voltage profiles provided the ion temperature, the ion and electron concentration,
   some ion composition information, and vehicle potential and plasma drift velocity parallel to the
   velocity vector. With the retarding grid at constant zero volts, current changes could be observed for
   3-s periods to obtain gradients of ion concentration. Electron parameters were measured in a manner
   similar to ions. Ions in mass ranges 1 to 4, 14 to 16, 24 to 32 and greater than 40 atomic mass units
   could be identified. The fourth sensor head was for the ion-drift velocity measurements, and consisted
   of four grounded grids, a negatively biased suppressor grid, and a four-segment collector. Differences
   in the collector segments' currents provided ion-drift directional component information. More details
   of this experiment are available in W. B. Hanson et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 333,
   1973.</Description>

      <Description>The Miniature Electrostatic Analyzer (MESA) obtained data on the neutral density of the
   atmosphere in the altitude range of 120 to 400 km, by the measurements of satellite deceleration due
   to aerodynamic drag, which is directly proportional to atmospheric density. The instrument consisted
   of three single-axis accelerometers, mounted mutually at right angles, two in the spacecraft X-Y plane
   and the other along the Z-axis. The instrument determined the applied acceleration from the electrostatic
   force required to recenter a proof mass. The output of the device was a digital pulse rate proportional
   to the applied acceleration. The sample time of each instrument was 0.25 s. The measurements allowed
   determination of the density of the neutral atmosphere, monitored the thrust of the Orbit-Adjust
   Propulsion System (OAPS), determined the satellite minimum altitude, measured spacecraft roll,
   and provided some attitude-sensing information. Spacecraft nutations of less than 0.01 deg were
   monitored. The instrument had three sensitivity ranges: 8.E-3 earth's gravity (G) in OAPS monitor mode;
   4.E-4 G between 120 km (plus or minus 2%) and 280 km (plus or minus 10%); and 2.E-5 G between 180 km
   (plus or minus 2%) and 400 km (plus or minus 10%). Numbers in parentheses represent errors. There may
   be a systematic error of up to plus or minus 5% due to drag coefficient uncertainty. The highest
   measurement altitude was determined assuming the instrument could sense to 0.2% of full scale.

      <Description>The CEP consisted of two identical instruments designed to measure electron temperatures,
   electron and ion concentrations, ion mass, and spacecraft potential. One probe was oriented along the
   spin axis of the spacecraft (usually perpendicular to the orbit plane), and the other radially, so
   that it could observe in the direction of the velocity vector once each 15-s spin period. Each
   instrument was a retarding-potential Langmuir-probe device that produced a current-voltage (I-V)
   curve for a known voltage pattern placed on the collector. Electrometers were used to measure the
   current. There were two systems of operation (one with two modes and another with three modes) using
   collector voltage patterns between plus and minus 5 volts. Most modes involved an automatic or fixed
   adjustment of collector voltage limits (and/or electrometer output) such that the region of interest
   on the I-V profile provided high resolution. Each system was designed for use with only one of the
   probes, but they could be interswitched to provide backup redundancy. The best measurements in the
   most favorable modes provided 1-s time resolution; electron temperature between 300 and 1.E4 deg K
   (10% accuracy); ion density between 1.E4 and 1.E7 ions/cc (10-20% accuracy); electron density between
   50 and 1.E6 electrons/cc; and ion mass at ion densities above 1.E4. Each probe had a collector
   electrode extending from the central axis of a cylindrical guard ring. The 2.5-cm-long guard ring
   was at the end of a 25-cm boom, and the collector extended another 7.5 cm beyond the guard ring.
   The boom, guard, and collector were 0.2 cm in diameter. More detailed information can be found in

      <Description>The Extreme Solar Ultraviolet Monitor (ESUM) experiment made absolute broadband
   spectro-radiometric measurements of the solar EUV flux from 200 A to Lyman-alpha at 1216 A and
   made precise measurements of the temporal variability. The instrument consisted of two identical
   windowless EUV photodiodes with aluminum oxide cathodes and a filter wheel containing two sets of
   unbacked metallic filters (aluminum, tin, indium) and an open position. A visible light diode
   measured the pinhole transmittance of the filters to determine the white light background. The
   tilt angle of the instrument relative to the +Z spacecraft axis was optimized for the maximum
   viewing time of the sun in both spinning and despun spacecraft modes. The instrument field of view
   was 60 deg. The nominal bandwidths in Angstroms for 50% of the signal were 270 to 550, 570 to 584,
   800 to 935, and 1216 A. More experiment details can be found in D. F. Heath and J. F. Osantowski,
   Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 361, 1973.
