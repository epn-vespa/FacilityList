      <Description>Injun 5 (Explorer 40) was a 71-kg magnetically oriented spacecraft and was launched by a Scout rocket, together with a
        3.65-m inflatable balloon (Explorer 39) used for air density measurements. Injun 5 was designed to accomplish the following objectives:
        (1) comprehensive study of the downward flux of charged particles, (2) study of very low frequency (VLF) radio emission in the ionosphere
        associated with the downward flux, (3) study of geomagnetically trapped protons, alpha particles, and electrons, (4) observation of solar
        cosmic rays, (5) observation of the continuing decay of the Starfish artificial radiation belt, and (6) study of the temperature and density
        of electrons and positive ions of thermal and near thermal energy. The spacecraft systems performed normally except for the malfunction of
        the solar cell power dump device (shortly after launch) which caused the solar cells to deliver a lower power level to the experiments and
        reduced the time during which the onboard tape recorder could be run. The passive magnetic alignment became effective in mid-December 1968.
        The spacecraft was turned off from May 31, 1970, to February 18, 1971, after this period it was turned on again. The spacecraft was put in
        an operational off-mode in early June 1971, and became inoperable shortly thereafter.

            <ResourceName>Injun 5 Very Low Frequency (VLF) Receiver</ResourceName>
            <ReleaseDate>2019-05-05T12:34:56Z</ReleaseDate>
            <Description>This very low frequency (VLF) receiver on Injun 5 was designed to study both electric and magnetic components
                (both phase and amplitude) of VLF signals. The direction of signal propagation could be determined and used to assist in
                identifying the origins of various VLF signals. The observations of antenna impedance for the electric antenna (ECA) were
                needed to study characteristics of such an antenna operating in a plasma. There were two antennas, one driving a magnetic-field
                component receiver (MCR), and the other driving two electric-field component receivers (ECR). The MCR operated from a
                55.9-cm-diameter loop antenna (MCA), and the ECRs operated from an antenna consisting of two 20.3-cm-diameter aluminum spheres
                mounted 2.85 m apart on opposite sides of the spacecraft (S/C). Both the MCA and ECA were mounted on booms to reduce interference
                from the S/C. Within a few weeks after launch, the S/C was despun and magnetically stabilized so that nominally, the antenna axes
                and the magnetic field line through the S/C were orthogonal. In the northern hemisphere, the MCA supporting boom was inclined
                earthward. Both the MCR and ECR operated from 10 to 30.E3 Hz. Also operating from the ECA was a narrow-band step frequency
                receiver (ECR 2) which operated through filters with center frequencies at 7.5, 10.5, 22, 52.5, 70, and 105 (plus or minus 7.5 %)
                kHz. Supplementary to these three receivers and two antennas were (1) a special circuit that could measure phase and amplitude of
                the impedance on the ECA between 20 and 2.E3 Hz and (2) an electron gun used to bias the ECA. The MCR and ECR 1 observed and
                telemetered (on a 0.8-W, 400-MHz channel) analog, broadband data in real time, when the S/C was in telemetry range of a ground
                station. When observing with the impedance circuit on, impedance measurements required 8 of each 30 s of wideband observing time.
                The signal strength values from the ECR 2, and separately from both the low (0.03 to 0.65 kHz) and high (0.3 to 10 kHz) ranges of
                the ECR 1 and MCR, were recorded on the S/C tape recorder and comprised the digital data for this experiment. In this experiment,
                the digital data were observed and recorded over a 30-s cycle within which the signal amplitudes from the two low-frequency steps
                of the ECR 2 were observed every 4 s (1-second duration) and the other frequencies observed every 8 s. When the impedance circuit
                was on, eight samples of the step receiver data were not observed during each 30-s cycle. Experiment performance was nominal. Failure
                of the S/C power regulator early in the mission limited operation to some extent, but nominal data were obtained until May 29, 1970.
                Principal telemetry sites for the data through May 1970 were in Iowa and Alaska. Further experiment details may be found in D. A.
