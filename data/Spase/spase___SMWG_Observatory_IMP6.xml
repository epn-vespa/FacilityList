      <Description>IMP-I continued the study, begun by earlier IMPs, of the interplanetary and outer magnetospheric regions by measuring energetic particles, plasma, and electric and magnetic fields. A radio astronomy experiment was also included in the spacecraft payload. The 16-sided spacecraft was 182.12 cm high by 135.64 cm in diameter. The spacecraft spin axis was normal to the ecliptic plane, and its spin rate was 5 rpm. The initial apogee point lay near the earth-sun line. The solar-cell and chemical-battery powered spacecraft carried two transmitters. One continuously transmitted PCM encoder data at a 1600-bps information bit rate. The second transmitter was used for transmission of VLF data and for ranging information. Three orthogonal pairs of dipole antennas were used for the electric fields experiments, and one of these pairs was also used for the radio astronomy experiment. The members of the antenna pair along the spacecraft spin axis extended 2.9 m, the members of the pair used in both the electric field and radio astronomy experiments extended 45.5 m, and the members of the third pair were slightly unbalanced, extending 24.4 and 27.6 m, respectively. All four elements perpendicular to the spin axis were to have extended 45.5 m. The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere October 2, 1974, after a highly successful mission.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment was designed to measure accurately the vector magnetic
      field in the interplanetary medium and in the earth's magnetosphere, magnetotail,
      and magnetosheath. The detector was a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate magnetometer
      with four ranges: minus to plus 16, 48, 144, and 432 nT, respectively. Corresponding
      sensitivities were plus or minus 0.06, 0.19, 0.56, and 1.69 nT, respectively.
      Automatic range selection capability was included. A flipping mechanism permitted
      inflight calibration of the three sensor zero levels. The vector sampling rate
      was 12.5 samples per second. The experiment functioned normally through the
      spacecraft life. For further details, see D. H. Fairfield, J. Geophys. Res.,
      v. 79, p. 1368, 1974. Hourly averaged interplanetary data also exist as part of
      data sets in the NSSDC supplementary data file.</Description>

      <Description>A hemispherical electrostatic analyzer was used to extend descriptions of the particle (electron and positive ion) populations in the solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetotail. Energy spectral analysis was accomplished by charging the plates to known voltage levels and allowing them to discharge with known RC time constants. The analyzer had four commandable modes. The first mode was designed for the measurement of solar wind protons and alpha particles. During eight spacecraft revolutions, 32-level energy spectra were obtained in eight angular ranges centered on the sun. The energy levels extended from 100 eV to 8 keV. The second mode was designed for the measurement of solar wind heavy ions. This cycle was the same as the first except that the energy per charge levels were limited to 900 eV to 8 keV, and the efficiency of counting heavy ions was increased relative to protons and alpha particles. The third mode was designed for the measurement of solar wind and magnetosheath electrons and magnetosheath positive ions. This was a combination cycle in which electron and positive ion spectral sweeps were alternated. During a cycle of nine spacecraft revolutions, eight electron spectra and eight positive ion spectra were obtained. The combined data for electrons in this mode consisted of 16-level energy spectra taken in 32 evenly spaced angular ranges. The spectra extended from 4 to 1000 eV. The data for positive ions consisted of 32-level spectra taken in the same 32 angular ranges. The energy per charge spectra extended from 100 eV to 8 keV. The fourth mode was designed for magnetotail electrons and positive ions. Electrons and positive ions were studied with 16-level spectra in 32 evenly-spaced angular ranges for both electrons and positive ions. The energy per charge ranges were 6 eV to 24 keV for electrons and 45 eV to 34 keV for positive ions. For further details see W. C. Feldman et al., J. Geophys. Res., v. 80, p. 4181, 1975.</Description>
