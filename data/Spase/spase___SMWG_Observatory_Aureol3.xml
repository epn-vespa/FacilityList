      <Description>Aureol 3 was a Soviet satellite that was part of the Intercosmos Series, subset AUOS-T (automatic universal orbital station terrestrial studies). The spacecraft was launched September 21, 1981, in a near-polar orbit. The center portion of the spacecraft was a pressurized cylinder 1.6 m in diameter and 2.7 m in height. Extending from the central body and deployed after launch were the telemetry and command antennas, the solar panels, and six booms holding various sensors away from the spacecraft. Magnetic torquing and gravity gradient were utilized to achieve three-axis stabilization. The Z axis of the spacecraft was aimed toward the center of the earth, the X axis was the direction of the spacecraft velocity vector. Both passive and active thermal control were used. Eight solar panels and 28-V batteries provided a maximum power of 250 W, and an average power of 50 W. The spacecraft carried a total of 12 experiments (4 from the USSR, 7 from France, and 1 done jointly by France and the USSR). The overall objectives were to provide some answers to the numerous questions related to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at high latitudes. The phenomena of interest included aurorae, magnetospheric substorms, origin and transport of plasmas, associated energies, electric currents, and electric fields. The experiments planned to meet these objectives included measurements of ambient electron density, electron temperature, and plasma velocity; of charged particles over the range 0.1 eV to 255 keV, plus electrons with energies above 40 keV and protons with energies above 500 keV; of dc electric and magnetic fields (0 to 10 Hz); of ELF and VLF waves in the range 0.01 to 16 kHz; of electric fields at frequencies from 0.1 to 16 MHz; and of auroral photometry at 4278 A, 4861 A, and 6300 A. Commands were either carried out in real time or stored on a weekly basis. Two instruments were used for onboard processing of experimental data. The correlometer provided cross-correlation and autocorrelation data for the measurement from either the four Kukushka detectors (81-094A-01) or two Kukushka and two Pietstchanka (81-094A-02) detectors. The ONTCH-2ME instrument provided onboard processing of the data from the ISO F (81-094A-09) and ISO M (81-094A-10) experiments. Two telemetry systems were used, a direct read-out system used over French telemetry stations and a delayed read-out system that used tape-recording and play back over the Soviet telemetry stations. The routine scheduling of operations for the French experiments was initiated weekly (on Fridays), 24 days in advance. It was coordinated through the French Centre d'Operations Specialise ARCAD 3 (COS A3) and forwarded to the Institute for Space Research (IKI), Moscow, where it was merged with the input from the Russian experimenters. It was then returned to France for concurrence and returned to IKI Moscow 11 days prior to the beginning of operations. The schedule was then finalized and distributed 5 days prior to the beginning of operations.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment consisted of a large-geometric-factor four-channel spectrometer in which incident protons and electrons, each in energy ranges 40-740 eV and 0.76-14 keV, were fed into four electrostatic analyzers. Each of these analyzers could be held at one of, or cycle through, eight energy steps. Energy resolution (delta-E)/E of these steps was 20%. Time resolution for simultaneous measurements in all four analyzers was 10, 80, 320, or 2560 ms according to which memory (ZAP) mode was in use. The instrument's entrance aperture made an angle of 75 deg with the satellite's axis of symmetry which is nominally oriented towards the zenith. For further details, see Galperin el al, Ann. Geophys., 38, 583, 1982.</Description>

            <Description>The electric and magnetic field probes (ONCH-TBF) on Aureol 3 measured the three components of the magnetic field at frequencies between 10 Hz and 16 kHz. The combined Soviet-French ONCH-TBF onboard instrument was designed to allow comprehensive measurements of both electric and magnetic wave fields. The measurements in real-time modes included 5-component wave-form data in the range 10 Hz - 1.5 kHz for 3 magnetic and 2 electric field components, or a wide-band mode in the range 10 Hz - 1.5 kHz, and several filter banks. In memory modes the data only from several filter-banks in the range from 10 Hz to 16 kHz were recorded. For further details, see Berthelier et al., Ann. Geophys., V. 38, N5, p. 643, 1982.</Description>

      <Description>This experiment used a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer primarily intended for spacecraft attitude determination and control, plus extra electronics needed to give magnetic field measurements of sufficient sensitivity and accuracy to study fields associated with field aligned currents. Normal spacecraft systems produced 8-bit magnetic field measurements, corresponding to +/- 200 nT precision. Special electronics (the TRAC system) produced a 12-bit measurement every 43-sec, plus 8-bit digitizations for the differences between N magnetic vectors/sec and the immediately preceding 43-sec digitized value. N ranged between 0.4 and 100 for the four available memory (ZAP) modes. Full magnetic vectors at full time resolution were reconstructed during ground data processing. With this approach, both the time resolution and precision (+/- 5 nT) of the data enable study of field-aligned current phenomena. Useful data were produced for the full life of the spacecraft (1981-1986). See Berthelier et al, Ann. Geophys., 38, 635, 1982, for further details.</Description>
