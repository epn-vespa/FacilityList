# ADS Harvard List

The Astrophysics Data System (ADS) used to propose a list of facilities1 , with its former web user interface. The current version of ADS is not using such a curated list. The list contains an identifier and a full name. For ground based observatories, the identifier is composed of pair of short names (observatory and telescope), separated by a . (dot) character. For spacecraft, the identifier starts with Sa. and is followed by a spacecraft short name.
