From these measurements, the nature of the event can be determined, and, by using a \ndistributed array of magnetometers, more information can be calculated about their time and spatial evolution.\n\nThe Northerly CARISMA station, Taloyoak, NUThe CARISMA array spans a range of longitude from Dawson \nCity, YK (near the Alaska border, 220.89\u00b0E) to Rankin Inlet, NU (267.89\u00b0E) and a range of latitude \nfrom Taloyoak, NU (69.54\u00b0N) to Osakis, MN, USA (45.87\u00b0N).  Currently most of these sites are on a \nNorth-South meridian known as the 'Churchill Line'.  By arranging the magnetometers in this way, \nit is possible to investigate the radial propagation of events, because the field measured at higher \nlatitudes is affected by regions further from the Earth than those measured at lower latitudes."

        "Description": "The Interball Project is a multi-national effort that consists of four spacecraft: two main spacecraft of the Prognoz series, made in Russia, each with a small subsatellite made in Czechoslovakia. The main objective is to study the physical mechanisms responsible for the transmission of solar wind energy to the magnetosphere, its storage there, and subsequent dissipation in the tail and auroral regions of the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere during magnetospheric substorms. A ground-based support group will provide coordinated and simultaneous ground-based data of many types, including observations from auroral and polar cap regions. Interball is an IACG-related mission. Key physical parameters will be generated, and will be available for exchange with other projects. Campaigns for intercomparison with the Wind and Geotail spacecraft are expected. One pair of spacecraft, Tail Probe and its subsatellite S2-X (X for the first letter of the Russian word for ``Tail''), will be launched into the magnetospheric tail. The second pair, Auroral Probe and S2-A (A for ``Auroral''), will have an orbit that crosses the auroral oval to observe the acceleration of auroral particles and the flow of electric currents that connect the magnetospheric tail with the conducting ionosphere. To study the equilibrium tail structure, during about half of each year the Tail Probe pair will cross the main parts of the magnetotail every four days. The Tail Probe, with approximately 30 earth radii apogee, will cross the noon-midnight plane on December 1, so the measurements in the magnetotail will cover the period from October 1995 to February 1996. The Auroral Probe pair will support the Tail Probe pair with auroral region measurements.\n\nEach main spacecraft has more than twenty scientific instruments. The spacecraft is cylindrical, with spin axis toward the sun (within 10 degrees), and with spin period of ~120 s. The electric and magnetic field sensors are on booms connected to the ends of the solar panels.\n\nThe subsatellites are small, each with about ten scientific instruments. The spin axis will be directed within 10 degrees of the sun, with a spin period of ~120 s, as with the main spacecraft. The subsatellites also carry gas-jet thrusters for limited control of the orbit. Separation distance will range from hundreds of kilometers to several tens of thousands of kilometers for the Tail Probe pair. Separation distance will range from hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers for the Auroral Probe pair. The Tail Probe has two telemetry systems, at up to 32 Kbps in real-time, with a memory mode capacity of 30 Mb in the RTK telemetry system and 120 Mb in the SSNI system. The Auroral Probe has similar capability plus the additional real-time-only STO system, capable of 40 Kbps. Each subsatellite has only the STO real-time telemetry system. For S2-X the rate can be varied from 2--40 kbps.\n\nThe Tail Probe has an adapting alert mode while in the memory mode, allowing time resolutions that are the same as in the real-time mode. The aim is to have the highest time resolution available at the thin borders of magnetospheric regions or the sharp borders of some features. In the alert mode (triggered by an on-board computer monitoring plasma and field parameters), the bit rate is increased for plasma, field, and wave measurements. The duration of these alert periods is about 10 minutes, and there can be 5--6 of them during one orbit."

Extended from the satellite shell were two dipole\n                antennas (45.7 m and 22.8 m long, respectively) which were shared by three of the experiments on the spacecraft.\n                The satellite was spin-stabilized at about 1.4 rpm after antenna extension. After about 500 days, the spin slowed more\n                than had been expected, to about 0.6 rpm when satellite spin-stabilization failed. It is believed that the satellite\n                gradually progressed toward a gravity gradient stabilization with the longer antenna pointing earthward. Attitude\n                information was deduced only from a single magnetometer and temperature measurements on the upper and lower heat shields.\n                Attitude determination could have been in error by as much as 10 degrees. There was no tape recorder, so data were available\n                only from the vicinity of telemetry stations. Telemetry stations were located to provide primary data coverage near the 80\n                degree W meridian and in areas near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, Europe, and Central Africa. Initially, data were recorded\n                for about six hours per day. In September 1972, spacecraft operations were terminated. A data restoration effort began in the\n                late nineties and successfully saved a considerable portion of the high-resolution data before the telemetry tapes were\n                discarded."

        "Description": "This mission was the first to be sent to the outer solar system and the first to investigate the planet Jupiter, after which it followed an escape trajectory from the solar system. The spacecraft achieved its closest approach to Jupiter on December 3, 1973, when it reached approximately 2.8 Jovian radii (about 200,000 km). As of Jan. 1, 1997 Pioneer 10 was at about 67 AU from the Sun near the ecliptic plane and heading outward from the Sun at 2.6 AU/year and downstream through the heliomagnetosphere towards the tail region and interstellar space. This solar system escape direction is unique because the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft (and the now terminated Pioneer 11 spacecraft mission) are heading in the opposite direction towards the nose of the heliosphere in the upstream direction relative to the inflowing interstellar gas. The spacecraft is heading generally towards the red star Aldebaran, which forms the eye of Taurus (The Bull). The journey over a distance of 68 light years to Aldebaran will require about two million years to complete. Routine tracking and project data processing operatations were terminated on March 31, 1997 for budget reasons. Occasional tracking continued later under support of the Lunar Prospector project at NASA Ames Research Center with retrieval of energetic particle and radio science data. The last successful data acquisitions through NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) occurred on March 3, 2002, the 30th anniversary of Pioneer 10's launch date, and on April 27, 2002. The spacecraft signal was last detected on Jan. 23, 2003 after an uplink was transmitted to turn off the last operational experiment, the Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT), but lock-on to the sub-carrier signal for data downlink was not achieved. No signal at all was detected during a final attempt on Feb. 6-7, 2003. Pioneer Project staff at NASA Ames then concluded that the spacecraft power level had fallen below that needed to power the onboard transmitter, so no further attempts would be made.\n\nThe history of the Pioneer 10 tracking status is available from the web site of the former Pioneer Project at the following location:\n\nhttp://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PNhome.html\n\nFifteen experiments were carried to study the interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields; solar wind parameters; cosmic rays; transition region of the heliosphere; neutral hydrogen abundance; distribution, size, mass, flux, and velocity of dust particles; Jovian aurorae; Jovian radio waves; atmosphere of Jupiter and some of its satellites, particularly Io; and to photograph Jupiter and its satellites. Instruments carried for these experiments were magnetometer, plasma analyzer, charged particle detector, ionizing detector, non-imaging telescopes with overlapping fields of view to detect sunlight reflected from passing meteoroids, sealed pressurized cells of argon and nitrogen gas for measuring the penetration of meteoroids, UV photometer, IR radiometer, and an imaging photopolarimeter, which produced photographs and measured polarization. Further scientific information was obtained from the tracking and occultation data.\n\nThe spacecraft body was mounted behind a 2.74-m-diameter parabolic dish antenna that was 46 cm deep. The spacecraft structure was a 36-cm-deep flat equipment compartment, the top and bottom being regular hexagons. Its sides were 71 cm long. One side joined a smaller compartment that carried the scientific experiments. The high-gain antenna feed was situated on three struts, which projected forward about 1.2 m. This feed was topped with a medium-gain antenna. A low-gain omnidirectional antenna extended about 0.76 m behind the equipment compartment and was mounted below the high-gain antenna. Power for the spacecraft was obtained by four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermonuclear generators (RTG), which were held about 3 m from the center of the spacecraft by two three-rod trusses 120 deg apart. A third boom extended 6.6 m from the experiment compartment to hold the magnetometer away from the spacecraft. The four RTG's generated about 155 W at launch and decayed to approximately 140 W by the time the spacecraft reached Jupiter, 21 months after launch. There were three reference sensors: a star sensor for Canopus which failed shortly after Jupiter encounter and two sun sensors. Attitude position could be calculated from the reference directions to the earth and the sun, with the known direction to Canopus as a backup. Three pairs of rocket thrusters provided spin-rate control and changed the velocity of the spacecraft, the spin period near the end of the mission being 14.1 seconds. These thrusters could be pulsed or fired steadily by command. The spacecraft was temperature-controlled between minus 23 deg C and plus 38 deg C. A plaque was mounted on the spacecraft body with drawings depicting a man, a woman, and the location of the sun and the earth in our galaxy.\n\nCommunications were maintained via (1) the omnidirectional and medium-gain antennas which operated together while connected to one receiver and (2) the high-gain antenna which was connected to another receiver. These receivers could be interchanged by command to provide some redundancy. Two radio transmitters, coupled to two traveling-wave tube amplifiers, produced 8 W at 2292 MHz each. Uplink was accomplished at 2110 MHz, while data transmission downlink was at 2292 MHz. The data were received by NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) at bit rates up to 2048 bps enroute to Jupiter and at 16 bps near end of the mission.\n\nSpace experiments mostly continued to operate for planetary or interplanetary measurements until failure or until insufficient spacecraft power from the RTG's was available for operation of all instruments, such that some were turned off permanently and others were cycled on and off in accordance with a power sharing plan implemented in September 1989. The Asteroid/Meteroid Detector failed in December 1973, followed by the Helium Vector Magnetometer (HVM) in November 1975 and the Infrared Radiometer in January 1974. The Meteroid Detector was turned off in October 1980 due to inactive sensors at low temperatures. The spacecraft sun sensors became inoperative in May 1986, and the Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) instrument was used to obtain roll phase and spin period information until being turned off in October 1993 to conserve power. The Trapped Radiation Detector (TRD) and Plasma Analyzer (PA) were respectively turned off in November 1993 and September 1995 for the same reason. As of January 1996 the final power cycling plan included part-time operations of the Charged Particle Instrument (CPI), the Cosmic Ray Telescope (CRT), the Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT), and the Ultraviolet Photometer (UV). As of August 2000, only the GTT instrument was still returning data.\n\nVarious other spacecraft subsystems also either failed or were turned off for power or other reasons, and an account of these may be of interest for engineering design of long duration deep space missions. The primary antenna feed offset bellows failed sometime in 1976 but a redundant unit was available for use thereafter. The Program Storage and Execution (PSE) subsystem was turned off in September 1989 for power conservation, after which spacecraft maneuvers were performed by ground command sequences. A receiver problem in mid-1992 prevented uplink to the high gain antenna, after which uplink commands could only be sent with 70-meter DSN antennas which also supported the 16 bps downlink. The Backup Line Heater experienced a sticking thermostat operation in March 1993 for 30 days but the problem did not reoccur. Undervoltage Protection Logic was turned off in December 1993 to prevent loss of critical spacecraft systems in the event of a transient undervoltage condition. Duration and Steering Logic (DSL) was turned off in February 1995 to conserve power, after which it was turned on again only for spacecraft maneuvers. RTG power levels are low enough that the spacecraft occasionally relies in part on battery power (accumulated during inactive periods) to run experiments and other systems.\n\nThe total mission cost for Pioneer 10 through the 1997 end of official science operations was about 350 million in FY 2001 U.S. dollars. This included about 200 million dollars for pre-launch design and development, and another 150 million for launch, telemetry tracking, mission operations and data analysis. These estimates were provided by the former Pioneer Project at NASA Ames Research Center."

        "Description": "Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series, the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull\n                of one planet (Venus) to reach another (Mercury), and the first spacecraft mission to visit two planets. Mariner 10 was the first\n                (and as of 2003 the only) spacecraft to visit Mercury. The spacecraft flew by Mercury three times in a retrograde heliocentric\n                orbit and returned images and data on the planet. Mariner 10 returned the first-ever close-up images of Venus and Mercury. The\n                primary scientific objectives of the mission were to measure Mercury's environment, atmosphere, surface, and body characteristics\n                and to make similar investigations of Venus. Secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the interplanetary medium and to\n                obtain experience with a dual-planet gravity-assist mission. The spacecraft structure was an eight-sided forger magnesium framework\n                with eight electronics compartments. It measured 1.39 m diagonally and 0.457 m in depth. Two solar panels, each 2.69 m long and 0.97\n                m wide, were attached at the top, supporting 5.1 sq m of solar cell area. Fully deployed the spacecraft measured 8.0 m across the\n                solar panels and 3.7 m from the top of the low-gain antenna to the bottom of the heat-shield. A scan platform with two degrees of\n                freedom was mounted on the anti-sunward face. A 5.8 m long hinged magnetometer boom extended from one of the octagonal sides of the\n                body. Total launch mass was 502.9 kg, of this 29 kg were propellant and attitude control gas. The total mass of instruments onboard\n                was 79.4 kg. The rocket engine was a 222-N liquid monopropellant hydrazine motor situated below a spherical propellant tank which was\n                mounted in the center of the framework. The nozzle protruded through a sunshade. Two sets of three pairs of orthogonal reaction\n                nitrogen gas jets, mounted on the tips of the solar panels, were used to stabilize the spacecraft on three axes. Command and control\n                were the responsibility of an on-board computer with a 512 word memory augmented by ground commands Mariner 10 carried a motor driven\n                high-gain dish antenna, a 1.37 m diameter aluminum honeycomb-disk parabolic reflector, which was mounted on a boom on the side of the\n                spacecraft. A low-gain omnidirectional antenna was mounted at the end of a 2.85 m boom extending from the anti-solar face of the\n                spacecraft. Feeds enabled the spacecraft to transmit at S- and X-band frequencies, data could be transmitted at a maximum rate of\n                117.6 kilobits per second. The spacecraft carried a Canopus star tracker, located on the upper ring structure of the octagonal\n                satellite, and acquisition sun sensors on the tips of the solar panels. The interior of the spacecraft was insulated with multilayer\n                thermal blankets at top and bottom. The sunshade was deployed after launch to protect the spacecraft on the solar-oriented side.\n                Louvered sides on five of the eight electronics compartments also helped control the interior temperatures. Instruments on-board the\n                spacecraft measured the atmospheric, surface, and physical characteristics of Mercury and Venus. Experiments included television\n                photography, magnetic field, plasma, infrared radiometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and radio science detectors. An experimental\n                X-band, high-frequency transmitter was flown for the first time on this spacecraft. Mariner 10 was placed in a parking orbit after\n                launch for approximately 25 minutes, then placed in orbit around the Sun en route to Venus. The orbit direction was opposite to the\n                motion of the Earth around the Sun. Mid-course corrections were made. The spacecraft passed Venus on February 5, 1974, at a distance\n                of 4200 km. It crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974, at 2046 UT, at a distance of about 704 km from the surface. The TV and\n                UV experiments were turned on the comet Kohoutek while the spacecraft was on the way to Venus. A second encounter with Mercury, when\n                more photographs were taken, occurred on September 21, 1974, at an altitude of about 47,000 km. A third and last Mercury encounter at\n                an altitude of 327 km, with additional photography of about 300 photographs and magnetic field measurements occurred on March 16,\n                1975. Engineering tests were continued until March 24, 1975, when the supply of attitude-control gas was depleted and the mission\n                was terminated. Total research, development, launch, and support costs for the Mariner series of spacecraft (Mariners 1 through 10)\n                was approximately $554 million. A back-up probe named Mariner-K was built and stood ready on a \"borrowed\" Atlas Centaur launch\n                vehicle, in case the Mariner 10 launch failed. This probe was later donated to the Smithsonian and the launch vehicle was used for\n                it's original purpose.\n"

        "Description": "BepiColombo is a joint European Space Agency, ESA, and Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA, Cornerstone mission to Mercury. The mission involves two components: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, MPO, and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter, MMO. MMO is also now known as Mio, which means a waterway in Japanese. According to JAXA, the name Mio symbolizes the research and development milestones reached thus far, and wishes for safe travel ahead. JAXA said the spacecraft will travel through the solar wind just like a ship traveling through the ocean. Due to budgetary constraints the lander portion, which was called Mercury Surface Element, MSE, of the mission has been cancelled.\n\nThe two components were launched together on an Arianne 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana at 01:45:28 UT on 19 October 2018. The spacecraft will have a nearly seven year interplanetary cruise to Mercury using solar-electric propulsion and gravity assists. There are nine scheduled planetary assist encounters as follows:\n\n+----------------------------------+\n| Flyby | Planet  | Encounter Date |\n|----------------------------------|\n|   1   | Earth   |   2020-04-06   |\n|   2   | Venus   |   2020-10-12   |\n|   3   | Venus   |   2021-08-11   |\n|   4   | Mercury |   2021-10-02   |\n|   5   | Mercury |   2022-06-23   |\n|   6   | Mercury |   2023-06-26   |\n|   7   | Mercury |   2024-09-05   |\n|   8   | Mercury |   2024-12-02   |\n|   9   | Mercury |   2025-01-09   |\n+----------------------------------+\n\nOn arrival at Mercury on 5 December 2025, the spacecraft will be captured into polar orbit, which will be lowered using chemical thrusters. The MPO and MMO will then separate into their own orbits, 400 km \u2a2f 1500 km, 2.3 h period for MPO, 400 km \u2a2f 12000 km, 9.2 h for MMO. The nominal mission will last one Earth year with a possible one year extension.\n\nThe scientific objectives for the BepiColombo mission are to study :\n\n* Origin and evolution of a planet close to its parent star\n* The figure, interior structure, and composition of Mercury\n* Exogenic and endogenic surface modifications, cratering, tectonics, and volcanism\n* Composition, origin, and dynamics of Mercury's exosphere and polar deposits\n* Interior dynamics and origin of the magnetic field of Mercury\n* Structure and dynamics of Mercury's magnetosphere\n* Test of Einstein's theory of general relativity\n\n* Spacecraft and Subsystems\n* -------------------------\n\nThe MPO and MMO spacecraft will each be driven by a Solar-Electric Propulsion Module, SEPM, and a chemical propulsion module, CPM. The SEPM is optimal for slow cruise manuevers and will consist of a set of Xenon ion thrusters housed in a rectangular prism powered by two GaAs-cell solar panel wings covering 33 square meters. The panels will be progressively tilted away from the Sun as the spacecraft gets closer from 0.6 AU to 0.32 AU in order to provide approximately constant power, about twice the 5.5 kW available at 1 AU. Three thrusters will be available, one or two to be used at any given time. The nominal thrust is planned to be 0.17 or 0.34 N. The total dry mass of the unit is 365 kg with 230 kg of xenon fuel for the MPO and 238 kg for the MMO. The CPM is a bi-propellant, Monomethylhydrazine N2O4-MMH, system for attitude control and orbital insertion. Attitude control will be achieved by eight 20 N thrusters while other maneuvers will be achieved with a single 4000 N engine. The dry mass of the CPM is 71 kg, with 156 kg of fuel for MPO and 334 kg for MMO. The total launch mass of the entire MPO system will be 1229 kg and for MMO about 1200 kg."

        "Description": "Pioneer 11 was the second mission to investigate Jupiter and the outer solar system and the first to explore the planet Saturn and its main rings. Pioneer 11, like Pioneer 10, used Jupiter's gravitational field to alter its trajectory radically. It passed close to Saturn and then it followed an escape trajectory from the solar system.\n\nThe spacecraft was 2.9 m long and contained a 2.74-m diameter high-gain antenna of aluminum honeycomb sandwich material whose feed was topped with a medium-gain antenna. A low-gain, omnidirectional antenna was mounted below the high-gain dish. The spacecraft contained two nuclear electric-power generators, which generated 144 W at Jupiter, but decreased to 100 W at Saturn. There were three reference sensors: a star (Canopus) sensor, and two sun sensors. Attitude position could be calculated from the reference direction to the earth and the sun, with the known direction to Canopus as backup. Pioneer 11's star sensor gain and threshold settings were modified, based on experience gained from the settings used on Pioneer 10. Three pairs of rocket thrusters provided spin-axis control (maintained at 4.8 rpm) and change of the spacecraft velocity. The thrusters could be either fired steadily or pulsed, by command.\n\nCommunications were maintained via the omnidirectional and medium-gain antennas, which operated together, connected to one receiver, while the high-gain antenna was connected to the other receiver. The receivers could be interchanged by command. Two radio transmitters, coupled to two traveling-wave tube amplifiers, produced 8 W power each in S-band. Communication uplink (earth to spacecraft) operated at 2110 MHz, and downlink (spacecraft to earth) at 2292 MHz. At Jupiter's distance, round-trip communication time took 92 min. Data were received at the Deep Space Network (DSN). The spacecraft was temperature-controlled to between -23 and +38 deg C (-10 to +100 deg F). An additional experiment, a low-sensitivity fluxgate magnetometer, was added to the Pioneer 11 payload.\n\nInstruments studied the interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields; solar wind properties; cosmic rays; transition region of the heliosphere; neutral hydrogen abundance; distribution, size, mass, flux, and velocity of dust particles; Jovian aurorae; Jovian radio waves; the atmospheres of planets and satellites; and the surfaces of Jupiter, Saturn, and some of their satellites. Instruments carried for these experiments were magnetometer, plasma analyzer (for solar wind), charged-particle detector, ionizing detector, non-imaging telescopes with overlapping fields of view to detect sunlight reflected from passing meteoroids, sealed pressurized cells of argon and nitrogen gas for measuring penetration of meteoroids, UV photometer, IR radiometer, and an imaging photopolarimeter, which produced photographs and measured the polarization. Further scientific information was obtained from celestial mechanics and occultation phenomena.\n\nThis spacecraft, like Pioneer 10, contains a plaque that has a drawing depicting man, woman, and the location of the sun and earth in the galaxy.\n\nDuring its closest approach, December 4, 1974, Pioneer 11 passed to within 34,000 km of Jupiter's cloud tops. It passed by Saturn on September 1, 1979, at a distance of 21,000 km from Saturn's cloud tops. The spacecraft has operated on a backup transmitter since launch. Instrument power sharing began in February 1985 due to declining RTG power output. Science operations and daily telemetry ceased on September 30, 1995 when the RTG power level was insufficient to operate any experiments. As of the end of 1995 the spacecraft was located at 44.7 AU from the Sun at a nearly asymptotic latitude of 17.4 degrees above the solar equatorial plane and was heading outward at 2.5 AU/year."

        "Description": "The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) orbited Mars over a seven year period and collected data on the surface morphology, topography, composition, gravity, atmospheric dynamics, and magnetic field. This data is used to investigate the surface processes, geology, distribution of material, internal properties, evolution of the magnetic field, and the weather and climate of Mars.\n     \nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe spacecraft itself is a rectangular box approximately 1.17 x 1.17 x 1.7 meters in size, made up of two parts, the equipment module and the propulsion module. All instruments except the magnetometer are stored on the nadir equipment deck, on one of the 1.17 x 1.17 meter surfaces. This is the top of the equipment module, which is 0.735 m high. The main thruster and propulsion tanks are on the opposite side from the instruments, on the propulsion module, which is approximately 1 meter high. Two solar panels, each 3.5 x 1.9 m in size, extend out from opposite sides of the craft. A 1.5 meter diameter parabolic high gain dish antenna is mounted on an adjacent side, and attached to a 2 meter boom, which is extended for mapping operations so the antenna is held away from the body of the spacecraft.\n\nThe spacecraft is three-axis stabilized with no scan platform. The main 596 N thruster used hydrazine and N2O4 propellant. Control is through 12 4.45 N hydrazine thrusters, mounted in four groups of three (two aft facing and one roll control thruster). The initial propellant load was 216.5 kg of hydrazine and 144 kg of N2O4. Four solar array panels (2 GaAs, 2 SI) provided 980 W of power to the spacecraft. Energy was stored in two 20 Amp-hr nickel hydrogen batteries, and supplied at 28 V DC. Temperature control was primarily passive with multilayer insulation, thermal radiators, and louvers, augmented by electrical heaters. Communications was achieved via the deep space network using the high gain antenna and two low gain antennas, one mounted on the high gain antenna and one on the equipment module. Uplink was in the X-band, downlink in the X and Ka bands. Minimum downlink rate was 21.33 kbps, 2 kbps engineering data downlink, and 10 bps emergency downlink.\n\nThe instruments on the nadir equipment deck consist of a camera, thermal emission spectrometer, laser altimeter, and a radio transmission relay. A magnetometer/electron reflectometer sensor is attached to the end of each solar array, and an ultra-stable oscillator is used for tracking and gravity determination. An 8086 processor is used for the payload data subsystem, and 1750A processors for the standard controls processor and the engineering data formatter. Data is stored on four 0.75 Gb solid state recorders.\n\nMission Profile\n\nAfter launch on a Delta 7925 (a Delta II Lite launch vehicle with nine strap-on solid-rocket boosters and a Star 48 (PAM-D) third stage) and a 10 month cruise phase, the Mars Global Surveyor was inserted into an elliptical capture orbit at 01:17 UT 12 September 1997. Over the next four months, it was intended that aerobraking maneuvers and thrusters would be used to lower the orbit to the final circular mapping orbit. However, one of the solar panels failed to latch properly when it was deployed and subsequently showed unexpected motion and moved past its fully deployed position when aerobraking began (thought to be due to the fracture of a damper arm and subsequent structural damage). A new aerobraking schedule was employed, which involved slower aerobraking putting less pressure on the solar panels through April 1998, at which time an 11.6 hour science phasing orbit with a 171 km periapsis was achieved and aerobraking was halted. After a 5 month hiatus, aerobraking was resumed on 23 September 1998. Science observations were made periodically during these maneuvers.\n\nAfter aerobraking ended in February 1999, MGS was in a 118 minute circular polar science mapping orbit with an index altitude of 378 km. The orbit is sun-synchronous (2 a.m./2 p.m.) and maps over the 2 p.m. crossing from south to north (instead of north to south as originally planned). The orbit has a 7 day near-repeat cycle so Mars will be mapped in 26 day cycles. Science mapping began in mid-March 1999, which was summer in the northern hemisphere on Mars. The primary mission lasted one martian year (687 Earth days) through January, 2001. An extended mission took place until April 2002, further extensions were added until contact with the spacecraft was lost on 2 November 2006."

        "Description": "Sakigake, whichs is the Japanese word that means Pioneer, was a test spacecraft similar to Suisei, which is also known by the name Planet-A. Sakigake flew by Comet P/Halley on its sunward side at a distance of about 7 million km on March 11, 1986. It carried three instruments to measure plasma wave spectra, solar wind ions, and interplanetary magnetic fields all of which worked normally. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized at two different rates measured in revolutions per minute, rpm: 5 rpm and 0.2 rpm, respectively. It was equipped with hydrazine thrusters for attitude and velocity control, star and sun sensors for attitude determination, and a mechanically despun off-set parabolic dish for long-range communication. Sakigake made an Earth swingby on January 8, 1992. The closest approach was at 23:08:47 JST, which is UTC+9h at a geocentric distance of 88,997 km. This was the first planet-swingby for a Japanese spacecraft. During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. A geotail passage occurred at 290 Earth radii, Re, on June 14, 1993 before ISTP's multi-spacecraft investigation of that region. The second Earth swingby was on June 14, 1993 at 40 Re and the third on October 28, 1994 at 86 Re. Almost no hydrazine remained so no further maneuvers were accomplished. Telemetry contact was lost on November 15, 1995 at a distance of 106 million km. Future mission planning had included a 23.6 km/s, 10,000 km flyby of Comet P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajdusakova on Feb 3, 1996 that would have had the spacecraft approaching the nucleus along the tail some 0.17 AU from the Sun, and a 14 million km passage of Comet P/Giacobini-Zinner on Nov 29, 1998."

(NSSDC will carry the name \"Cluster96\" in its information files to designate the unsuccessful\n   1996 four-spacecraft Ariane 5 launch.)\n\nPhoenix was approved in July 1996 as a replacement for the lost four-spacecraft group. It was later (April 1997) agreed that\nthe potential science return from a full Cluster reflight was so important that a further three near-replicas of the original\nspacecraft would also be built.\n\nThis Cluster II spacecraft, FM5 (Rumba), was launched together with FM8 (Tango) by a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Baikonur. The\nfour similar spacecraft of the Cluster II mission are part of ESA's and NASA's Solar-Terrestrial Science Program (STSP). The\npurpose of the Cluster II mission is to study small-scale structures in three dimensions in the Earth's plasma environment,\nsuch as those involved in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma, in global magnetotail dynamics,\nin cross-tail currents, and in the formation and dynamics of the neutral line and of plasmoids.\n\nThe four Cluster II spacecraft will orbit in a tetrahedral formation in near-polar orbits of nominally 4 x 19.6 Earth radii,\nwith period about 57 hours, and inclination about 90.7 degrees. Relative distances between the spacecraft will be adjusted\nin the course of the mission, depending on the spatial scales of the structures to be studied, varying from a few hundred\nkm to a few Earth radii. The tetrahedral formation is essential for making three-dimensional measurements and for determining\nthe curl of vectorial quantities such as the magnetic field.\n\nThe orbits of all four spacecraft will be frequently maneuvered so as to achieve the targeted investigations.\n\nEach spacecraft will be spin-stabilized, normally at around 15 rpm, and will be cylindrical in shape, with a\n2.9-m diameter and 1.3-m length. It will have two rigid 5-m radial experiment booms, four 50-m experiment wire booms,\nand two axial telecommunications antenna booms. Telemetry downlink bit rate will be 2 to 262 kbit/s.\n\nEach spacecraft will have AC and DC magnetometers, an electric fields and waves sensor, an electron emitter/detector,\nan electron density sounder, electron and ion plasma analysers, an energetic particle detector, an ion emitter, and\na data processing unit.\n\nCluster operations will be performed by ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany, with support from NASA's Deep Space Network.\nCluster is also an IACG mission. The scientific data are distributed by ESOC using CD-ROM as a medium to the\nPrincipal Investigators, Co-Investigators and the network of eight national data centres (6 in Europe, 1 in USA\nand 1 in China) that form the Cluster Science Data System (CSDS). There are approximately 80 recipients world-wide.\nScience operations are carried out by the Joint Science Operations Centre, co-located with the UK data centre at RAL,\nDidcot.

        "Description": "Alouette 2 was a small ionospheric observatory instrumented with a sweep-frequency ionospheric sounder, a VLF receiver, an energetic particle experiment, a cosmic noise experiment, and an electrostatic probe. The spacecraft used two long dipole antennas (73 m and 22.8 m, respectively) for the sounder, VLF, and cosmic noise experiments. The satellite was spin-stabilized at about 2.25 rpm after antenna deployment. End plates on the 73 m antenna corrected the rapid despin that had occurred on Alouette 1, and which was believed to result from thermal distortion of the antenna and from radiation pressure. There was no tape recorder, so that data were available only when the spacecraft was in line of sight of telemetry stations. Telemetry stations were located so that primary data coverage was near the 80 deg W meridan plus areas near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, the UK, India, Norway, and Central Africa. Initially data were recorded about 8 h per day. Degradation of the power supply system had, by June 1975, reduced the operating time to about 1/2 h per day. Routine operations were terminated in July 1975. The spacecraft was successfully reactivated on November 28 and 29, 1975, in order to obtain data on its 10th annniversary."

This region, where ionized plasma and neutral gas collide and react exhibits dramatic variability that affects space-based technological systems like GPS. \n\t  \n\t  Though the solar inputs are now well quantified, the drivers of ionospheric variability originating from lower atmospheric regions are not. ICON is the first space mission to simultaneously retrieve all of the properties of the system that both influence and result from the dynamical and chemical coupling of the atmosphere and ionosphere. ICON achieves this through an innovative measurement technique that combines remote optical imaging and in situ measurements of the plasma. With this approach, ICON gives us the ability to (1) separate the drivers and pinpoint the real cause of ionospheric variability (2) explain how energy and momentum from the lower atmosphere propagate into the space environment, and (3) explain how these drivers set the stage for the extreme conditions of solar-driven magnetic storms. The  imaging capability of ICON combined with its in-situ measurements on the same spacecraft (Figure 1) gives a perspective of the coupled system that would otherwise require two or more orbiting observatories. \n\t  \n\t  ICON targets the low-latitude ionosphere because recent global-scale observations of this region show remarkable spatial and temporal variability that contravene the conventional view of ion-neutral coupling in space, and evince strong forcing by lower atmosphere drivers. The coupling of the atmosphere to space is strongest at these latitudes because the atmospheric waves are largest and so is the density of the space plasma, produced in abundance by the sun overhead and confined by the magnetic field."

The detailed science objectives are:\n\n* 1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona\n* 2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind\n* 3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. To accomplish these objectives, the spacecraft carries four primary instruments - the Fields Experiment, the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun, The Wide-Field Imager for Solar Probe, and the Solar Wind Alphas and Protons Investigation.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe spacecraft bus is a hexagonal prism with two large solar panel wings protruding from near the middle of the bus and a cone-shaped thermal protection system (TPS) on the Sun-facing end. Total mass including 130 kg of propellant is 685 kg. The bus is 3 m long and 1 m in diameter, the end of the TPS is 2.3 m in diameter. The TPS is a 11.43 cm thick carbon composite shield.\n\nThe solar arrays produce 384 W power at solar encounter. They are actively cooled, each 1.12 m long by 0.69 m wide for a total area of 1.55 square meters. Propulsion is provided by a hydrazine tank mounted in the center of the bus and 12 4.4-N blowdown monoprop hydrazine thrusters. Attitude control is achieved by use of reaction wheels. Communications are via a 0.6 m diameter high-gain antenna (for science downlink) mounted near the middle of the cylinder, two fan-beam and two low-gain antennas for uplink and telemetry) and a 34 W TWTA in the Ka-band with a science downlink rate of 167 kb/s at 1 AU distance. A boom holding science sensors extends from the end of the spacecraft facing away from the Sun.\n\nMission Profile\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe launched on 12 August 2018 at 07:31 UT from Cape Canaveral, on a Delta IV Heavy with a Star 48 BV upper stage. A Venus flyby at an altitude above the surface of approximately 2500 km on 3 October 2018 was used to put the probe into its final heliocentric orbit, followed by its first perihelion on 6 November 2018. Six more Venus flybys [26 Dec 2019 (altitude approximately 3000 km), 11 July 2020 (800 km), 20 Feb 2021 (2400 km), 16 Oct 2021 (3800 km), 21 Aug 2023 (3900 km), 6 Nov 2024 (300 km)] are used to progressively trim the orbit to allow its close solar approaches in 2024 and 2025. The perihelions range from 24.3 million km to 6.86 million km (23.6 million km to 6.16 million km from the surface of the Sun). Aphelion range from 0.73 to 1.02 AU. Primary science will be done over approximately 11 days bracketing each closest approach, data downlink will be done over the remaining 77-158 days, depending on the orbit.\n\nThe mission is named for physicist Eugene Parker, who first theorized the existence of the solar wind and the complex interactions involving plasmas, magnetic fields, and energetic particles involved in 1958. He is the first living person to have a NASA spacecraft named after him."

The primary scientific objectives of the mission are to collect data to investigate:\n\n* 1) The formation and origin of the Jovian atmosphere and the potential migration of planets through the measurement of Jupiter's global abundance of oxygen and nitrogen present in water and ammonia, respectively\n* 2) Variations in Jupiter's deep atmosphere related to meteorology, composition, temperature profiles, cloud opacity, and atmospheric dynamics\n* 3) The fine structure of Jupiter's magnetic field, providing information on its internal structure and the nature of the dynamo\n* 4) The gravity field and distribution of mass inside the planet\n* 5) Jupiter's three-dimensional polar magnetosphere and aurorae\n\nJuno carries eight experiments to achieve these objectives. Juno was the second mission chosen for the New Frontiers program.\n\n* Spacecraft and Subsystems\n* =========================\n\nThe spacecraft is built around a hexagonal cylinder bus measuring 3.5 m in diameter \u2a2f 3.5 m in height. Three solar panel wings extend from alternate sides of the hexagon giving a total diameter of approximately 20 m. A high gain antenna is mounted on top of the bus, with instruments mounted on the deck and propellant, oxygen, and pressurant tanks mounted within. At the center of the top deck is a 0.8 m \u2a2f 0.8 m \u2a2f 0.6 m titanium $quot;vault$quot;, which houses the spacecraft avionics and critical systems to protect them from the severe jovian radiation environment. The vault has a mass of 150 kg and walls up to over a cm in thickness. Power is provided by ultra triple junction Galium arsenide, GaAs, solar cells, covered with thick glass for radiation shielding, which are grouped into 11 solar panels, four on two of the wings and three on the remaining one. The end of the third wing is a boom structure holding science instruments. The solar panels will produce a total of 18 kW at Earth and 400 W initially at Jupiter.

There was one Earth flyby on October 9, 2013 with a closest approach of about 559 km at 19:21 UT or 3:21 pm EST. Juno was inserted into its initial 53.5 d Jupiter polar orbit on July 5, 2016 with confirmation of the completion of the 35 minute engine burn received at Earth at 03:53 UT or 11:53 pm EDT on July 4th. The science orbit will be a 14 day near-polar 90\u00b0\u00b110\u00b0 orbit with a perijove of roughly 1.05 Jovian radii, Rj, which is about 4200 km above the cloud tops at its closest and an apojove of 39 Rj. The spacecraft will be rotating at 2 revolutions per minute, rpm, during the science orbit. Due to the intense radiation environment close to Jupiter, the mission will receive a critical dosage fairly rapidly and is planned to last for 37 orbits. At the end of the mission Juno will be deorbited and burn up in Jupiter's atmosphere."

Most importantly, THEMIS will find out which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset: (a) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current; or, (b) that current's interaction with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from lobe flux annihilation at ~25Re. Three inner probes at ~10Re will monitor current disruption onset, while two outer probes, at 20 and 30Re respectively, will remotely monitor plasma acceleration due to lobe flux dissipation. The five small satellites were launched together on a Delta II rocket and they carry identical sets of instruments including an electric field instrument (EFI), a flux gate magnetometer (FGM), a search coil magnetometer (SCM), a electro-static analyzer, and solid state telescopes (SST). The mission consists of several phases. In the first phase, the spacecraft will all orbit as a tight cluster in the same orbital plane with apogee at 15.4 Earth radii (RE). In the second phase, also called the Dawn Phase, the satellites will be placed in their orbits and during this time their apogees will be on the dawn side of the magnetosphere. During the third phase (also known as the Tail Science Phase) the apogees will be in the magnetotail. The fourth phase is called the Dusk Phase or Radiation Belt Science Phase, with all apogees on the dusk side. In the fifth and final phase, the apogees will shift to the sunward side (Dayside Science Phase).\n\nAll five satellites will have similar perigee altitudes (1.16-1.5 Re) but varying apogee altitudes (P1: ~30 RE, P2: ~20 RE, P3 & P4: ~12 RE, P5: ~10RE) with corresponding orbital periods of ~4, 2, and 1 days, respectively. This results in multi-point magnetic conjunctions. Every four days the satellites will line up along the Earth's magnetic tail with magnetic foot points in the North American sector, allowing the tracking of disturbances through different geospace regions from tail to ground.\n\nThe satellite data will be combined with observations of the aurora from a network of 20 ground observatories (all sky imagers, magnetometers) across the North American continent. In addition to its primary goal, THEMIS will answer critical questions in radiation belt physics and solar wind - magnetosphere energy coupling. THEMIS is complementary to MMS in terms of the temporal and spatial scales of the phenomena observed by these two constellation missions. THEMIS's focus is macroscale, whereas MMS will observe micro/meso scale features. "

The two spacecraft are launched to drift slowly away from the Earth in opposite directions at about 10 degrees per year for the lagging spacecraft and 20 degrees per year for the leading one. Optimal longitudinal separation of about sixty degrees is achieved after two years. Afterwards the separation gradually increases beyond the design lifetime of two years with the possibility of extended mission observations at larger angles. Science instruments selected for STEREO include the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) for extreme ultraviolet (EUV), white-light coronographic, and heliospheric imaging, the STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) interplanetary radio burst tracker, the In situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) investigation for in-situ sampling the 3-D distribution and plasma characteristics of solar energetic particles and the interplanetary magnetic field, and the PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC) experiment to measure elemental and charge composition of ambient and CME plasma ions. STEREO data recorded and stored onboard each spacecraft will be downlinked through the NASA Deep Space Network on a daily schedule. Real-time space weather data will be continuously transmitted through a separate beacon system to NASA and non-NASA receiving stations."

The specific scientific goals of this mission were:\n     \n      * (1) to study acceleration processes in the solar corona and flare acceleration of charged particles;\n      * (2) to monitor the propagation of accelerated particles from the solar corona to interplanetary space;\n      * (3) to observe particle acceleration from interplanetary shock fronts;\n      * (4) to measure the chemical and charge composition of the solar wind and solar energetic particles;\n      * (5) to study instability processes in interplanetary plasma and wave environments;\n      * (6) to study the propagation and penetration into the magnetosphere of solar plasma and energetic particles;\n      * (7) to monitor magnetotail plasma dynamics during substorms;\n      * (8) to search for discrete gamma ray lines of solar and galactic origin, and\n      * (9) to study UV-emission in the upper atmosphere and the interplanetary medium.\n     \n      Launch Date: 1977-09-22 at 00:51:00 UTC\n     \n      Orbital parameters:\n     \n      +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n      | Periapsis  |  Apoapsis       |  Period              |  Inclination      |  Eccentricity  |\n      |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n      | 498.0 km  | 197900.0 km | 5684.0 minutes |             65.0\u00b0 |      0.934828  |\n      +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n     \n      Prognoz is the name of the once soviet Earth research artificial satellites (ISZ for Russian) meant to study processes of solar activity, their influence on interplanetary environment and the Earth magnetosphere.\n\nThe mass of the ISZ Prognoz 6 was 910 kg. Prognoz consists of the hermetically sealed cylinder-shaped mainframe (of 2 m diameter) with spherical bottoms. Inside the mainframe (of the 0,925 m height) the platform with instrumentation and equipment is located. The sensors and units of the scientific instrumentation as well as cylinders (containers, envelopes) etc. are installed on the outside surface of the mainframe. During flight Prognoz is sun-oriented with its lengthwise axis. This specified position is provided by the system of orientation and maintained by rotation around the longitudinal axis. The system of orientation includes the solar sensor, control units and controlling reactive nozzles operating on the compressed nitrogen.\n\nPower supply of the board instrumentation is provided by solar batteries (4 plane panels unfolding when taken to the orbit; with the 6 m span) and floating battery. The system of temperature control is active; the side surface of the hermetically sealed body is used as a radiation surface; the rest of the mainframe is protected by the shield-vacuum thermal insulation. The board radio complex ensures the receipt of radio commands from the Earth, measurement of the orbit parameters and transmission of telemetric information. The telemetric system is equipped with the memory facility for registering information between radio sessions and for subsequent its transmission to the Earth during another communication session. Data were obtained from a 5-megabit storage during each perigee so that continuous data acquisition over the whole orbit was achieved."

The spacecraft had a planned lifetime of one year. The science investigations used the following five flight sensors: a Drag Balance Instrument (DBI) for determining neutral density, a Wind and Temperature Spectrometer (WATI), an Ion Velocity Instrument (IVI), an Airglow-Solar Spectrometer (ASSI), and an Electric Field Meter (EFI). The satellite was a 96.5 cm-diameter sphere with four 48 cm canted monopole telemetry antennas and three orthogonal pairs of electric field probe sensors (one pair oriented along the spacecraft spin axis). An internal structural cylinder (26 cm diameter) extends slightly through the sphere and was coincident with the satellite spin axis. The power supply consisted of a solar-cell array split into two sections, two rechargeable NiCd batteries, and associated circuitry. The satellite attitude data were provided by a triaxial magnetometer, a horizon sensor, a digital sun sensor, and a star tracker for calibration. A magnetic torquing system was used to control spin rate and spacecraft attitude. The spacecraft reentered on schedule on December 6, 1988. All instruments operated as planned, except WATI which failed to respond to commands after 20 days (fuse failure). The spacecraft performed nominally throughout its lifetime. Final data were acquired at 150 Km during re-entry."

        "Description": "The Apollo 14 Lunar Module (LM) \"Antares\" was the third crewed vehicle to land on the Moon. It carried two astronauts, Commander Alan B. Shepard Jr. and LM pilot Edgar D. Mitchell, the fifth and sixth men to walk on the Moon. Also included on the LM was the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) containing scientific experiments to be deployed and left on the lunar surface and other scientific and sample collection apparatus.\n\nMission Profile\n\nThe LM separated from the Command/Service Module (CSM) at 04:50:44 UT and landed at 09:18:11 UT (4:18:11 a.m. EST) on 5 February 1971 in the lunar highlands near the crater Fra Mauro at 3.6453 S latitude, 17.4714 W longitude (IAU Mean Earth Polar Axis coordinate system). The LM landed on the slope of a small depression, tilted at 8 degrees. Shepard and Mitchell made two moonwalk extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) totaling 9 hours, 23 minutes. The first EVA began at 14:42:13 UT and ended at 19:30:03 UT. During this first EVA the astronauts deployed the ALSEP and other experiments. During the second EVA, which took place from 8:11:15 to 12:45:56 UT on 6 February, the astronauts walked almost to the rim of nearby Cone crater, collecting samples along the traverse. At the end of this walk Shepard used a contingency sampler with a 6-iron connected to the end to hit two golf balls. The astronauts traversed a total of 3.45 km and collected 42.28 kg of lunar samples. The LM lifted off the Moon on 6 February at 18:48:42 UT after 33 hours 31 minutes on the lunar surface. After docking with the CSM (piloted by Stuart A. Roosa) at 20:35:53 UT, the LM was jettisoned at 22:48:00 UT and impacted the Moon at 3.42 S, 19.67 W, between the Apollo 12 and Apollo 14 seismic stations, at 00:45:25 UT on 7 February.\n\nLunar Module Spacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe lunar module was a two-stage vehicle designed for space operations near and on the Moon. The spacecraft mass of 15,264 kg was the mass of the LM including astronauts, expendables, and 11,010 kg of propellants. The fully fueled mass of the ascent stage was 4943 kg and the descent stage 10,334 kg. The ascent and descent stages of the LM operated as a unit until staging, when the ascent stage functioned as a single spacecraft for rendezvous and docking with the command and service module (CSM). The descent stage comprised the lower part of the spacecraft and was an octagonal prism 4.2 meters across and 1.7 m thick. Four landing legs with round footpads were mounted on the sides of the descent stage and held the bottom of the stage 1.5 m above the surface. The distance between the ends of the footpads on opposite landing legs was 9.4 m. One of the legs had a small astronaut egress platform and ladder. A one meter long conical descent engine skirt protruded from the bottom of the stage. The descent stage contained the landing rocket, two tanks of aerozine 50 fuel, two tanks of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, water, oxygen and helium tanks and storage space for the lunar equipment and experiments, and in the case of Apollo 15, 16, and 17, the lunar rover. The descent stage served as a platform for launching the ascent stage and was left behind on the Moon.\n\nThe ascent stage was an irregularly shaped unit approximately 2.8 m high and 4.0 by 4.3 meters in width mounted on top of the descent stage. The ascent stage housed the astronauts in a pressurized crew compartment with a volume of 6.65 cubic meters. There was an ingress-egress hatch in one side and a docking hatch for connecting to the CSM on top. Also mounted along the top were a parabolic rendezvous radar antenna, a steerable parabolic S-band antenna, and 2 in-flight VHF antennas. Two triangular windows were above and to either side of the egress hatch and four thrust chamber assemblies were mounted around the sides. At the base of the assembly was the ascent engine. The stage also contained an aerozine 50 fuel and an oxidizer tank, and helium, liquid oxygen, gaseous oxygen, and reaction control fuel tanks. There were no seats in the LM. A control console was mounted in the front of the crew compartment above the ingress-egress hatch and between the windows and two more control panels mounted on the side walls. The ascent stage was launched from the Moon at the end of lunar surface operations and returned the astronauts to the CSM.\n\nThe descent engine was a deep-throttling ablative rocket with a maximum thrust of about 45,000 N mounted on a gimbal ring in the center of the descent stage. The ascent engine was a fixed, constant-thrust rocket with a thrust of about 15,000 N. Maneuvering was achieved via the reaction control system, which consisted of the four thrust modules, each one composed of four 450 N thrust chambers and nozzles pointing in different directions. Telemetry, TV, voice, and range communications with Earth were all via the S-band antenna. VHF was used for communications between the astronauts and the LM, and the LM and orbiting CSM. There were redundant tranceivers and equipment for both S-band and VHF. An environmental control system recycled oxygen and maintained temperature in the electronics and cabin. Power was provided by 6 silver-zinc batteries. Guidance and navigation control were provided by a radar ranging system, an inertial measurement unit consisting of gyroscopes and accelerometers, and the Apollo guidance computer.\n\nApollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP)\n\nThe Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) consisted of a set of scientific instruments emplaced at the landing site by the astronauts. The instruments were arrayed around a central station which supplied power to run the instruments and communications so data collected by the experiments could be relayed to Earth. The central station was a 25 kg box with a stowed volume of 34,800 cubic cm. Thermal control was achieved by passive elements (insulation, reflectors, thermal coatings) as well as power dissipation resistors and heaters. Communications with Earth were achieved through a 58 cm long, 3.8 cm diameter modified axial-helical antenna mounted on top of the central station and pointed towards Earth by the astronauts. Transmitters, receivers, data processors and multiplexers were housed within the central station. Data collected from the instruments were converted into a telemetry format and transmitted to Earth. The ALSEP system and instruments were controlled by commands from Earth. The uplink frequency for all Apollo mission ALSEP's was 2119 MHz, the downlink frequency for the Apollo 14 ALSEP was 2279.5 MHz.\n\nRadioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)\n\nThe SNAP-27 model RTG produced the power to run the ALSEP operations. The generator consisted of a 46 cm high central cylinder and eight radiating rectangular fins with a total tip-to-tip diameter of 40 cm. The central cylinder had a thinner concentric inner cylinder inside, and the two cylinders were attached along their surfaces by 442 spring-loaded lead-telluride thermoelectric couples mounted radially along the length of the cylinders. The generator assembly had a total mass of 17 kg. The power source was an approximately 4 kg fuel capsule in the shape of a long rod which contained plutonium-238 and was placed in the inner cylinder of the RTG by the astronauts on deployment. Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 89.6 years and produces heat. This heat would conduct from the inner cylinder to the outer via the thermocouples which would convert the heat directly to electrical power. Excess heat on the outer cylinder would be radiated to space by the fins. The RTG produced approximately 70 W DC at 16 V. (63.5 W after one year.) The electricity was routed through a cable to a power conditioning unit and a power distribution unit in the central station to supply the correct voltage and power to each instrument.\n\nALSEP Scientific Instruments\n\nAll ALSEP instruments were deployed on the surface by the astronauts and attached to the central station by cables. The Apollo 14 ALSEP instruments consisted of: (1) a passive seismometer, designed to measure seismic activity and physical properties of the lunar crust and interior; (2) an active seismometer to study the physical properties of lunar surface and subsurface materials and the structure of the local near-surface layers; (3) a suprathermal ion detector, designed to measure the flux composition, energy, and velocity of low-energy positive ions; (4) a charged particle lunar environment experiment, designed to measure particle energies of solar protons and electrons that reach the lunar surface; (5) a cold cathode ion gauge, designed to measure the atmosphere and any variations with time or solar activity such atmosphere may have; and (6) a lunar dust detector, to measure dust accumulation, radiation damage to solar cells, and reflected infrared energy and temperatures. The central station, located at 3.6440 S latitude, 17.4775 W longitude, was turned on at 17:23 UT on 5 February 1971 and shut down along with the other ALSEP stations on 30 September 1977."

These events are responsible for large solar energetic particle events in interplanetary space and are the primary cause of major geomagnetic storms at Earth. The two spacecraft are launched to drift slowly away from the Earth in opposite directions at about 10 degrees per year for the lagging spacecraft and 20 degrees per year for the leading one. Optimal longitudinal separation of about sixty degrees is achieved after two years. Afterwards the separation gradually increases beyond the design lifetime of two years with the possibility of extended mission observations at larger angles. Science instruments selected for STEREO include the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) for extreme ultraviolet (EUV), white-light coronographic, and heliospheric imaging, the STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) interplanetary radio burst tracker, the In situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) investigation for in-situ sampling the 3-D distribution and plasma characteristics of solar energetic particles and the interplanetary magnetic field, and the PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC) experiment to measure elemental and charge composition of ambient and CME plasma ions. STEREO data recorded and stored onboard each spacecraft will be downlinked through the NASA Deep Space Network on a daily schedule. Real-time space weather data will be continuously transmitted through a separate beacon system to NASA and non-NASA receiving stations."

        "Description": "Rosetta was European Space Agency, ESA, Horizon 2000 cornerstone mission number 3 designed to rendezvous with Comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, drop a probe on the surface, study the comet from orbit, and fly by at least one asteroid en route. The principal goals are to study the origin of comets, the relationship between cometary and interstellar material, and its implications with regard to the origin of the solar system. Its scientific objectives to achieve these goals are:\n\n* 1) Global characterization of the nucleus, determination of dynamic properties, surface morphology and composition\n* 2) Determination of the chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic compositions of volatiles and refractories in a cometary nucleus\n* 3) Determination of the physical properties and interrelation of volatiles and refractories in a cometary nucleus\n* 4) Study of the development of cometary activity and the processes in the surface layer of the nucleus and the inner coma where dust/gas interactions occur\n* 5) Global characterisation of asteroids, including determination of dynamic properties, surface morphology, and composition\n\n* Spacecraft and Subsystems\n* =========================\n\nRosetta's design was based on a box-shaped central frame, 2.8 m \u2a2f 2.1 m \u2a2f 2.0 m with an aluminum honeycomb main platform. Total launch mass was 3000 kg including the 100 kg lander and 165 kg of scientific instruments. Two solar panels, 32 m$#i178; each, extend outward from opposite sides of the box spanning 32 m tip-to-tip. The spacecraft consists of two primary modules, the Payload Support Module, PSM, which holds the scientific instrumentation and two payload boom deployment mechanisms in the top part of the frame and the Bus Support Module, BSM, which holds the spacecraft subsystems in the lower part. A steerable 2.2 m diameter high-gain parabolic dish antenna was attached to one side, and the lander will be mounted on the opposite side. The science instrument panel was mounted on the top and was designed to be facing the comet continuously during orbit while the antenna and solar panels faced the Earth and Sun. Radiators and louvers were mounted on the back and side panels which face away from the Sun and comet. In the center of the spacecraft protruding from the bottom was a vertical thrust tube made of corrugated aluminum with strengthening rings.\n\nThe thrust tube provided the propulsion for primary maneuvers and contains two 1106 liter propellant tanks, the upper one containing propellant and the lower one oxidizer. A total of 660 kg of bipropellant monomethyl hydrazine propellant and 1060 kg of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer was necessary to provide 2200 m/s delta-V over the course of the mission. The launch mass of the craft including fuel was 2900 kg. There were also four 35 liter pressurant tanks. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized and the orientation controlled by 24 10 N thrusters. Attitude was maintained using two star trackers, a Sun sensor, navigation cameras, and three laser gyro packages. Power was supplied by the solar arrays, which was composed of low intensity, low temperature Silicon, Si, or Gallium arsenide, GaAs, solar cells. These provided 400 W at 5.2 AU and 850 W at 3.4 AU, when comet operations began. Power was stored in four 10 A hr Nickel Cadmium, NiCd, batteries which supplied the 28 V bus power. Communications were accompliched via the high-gain antenna, a fixed 0.8 meter medium-gain antenna, and two omnidirectional low gain antennas. Rosetta utilized an S-band telecommand uplink and S-band and X-band telemetry and science data downlink, with data transmission rates ranging from 5 kbits/s to 20 kbits/s. Communication equipment included a 28 W Radio Frequency, RF, X-band travelling wave tube amplifier, TWTA, and a dual 5 W RF S/X band transponder. Onboard heaters were used to keep the instrumentation from freezing during the period when the spacecraft was far from the Sun.\n\n* Philae Lander\n* =============\n\nThe Rosetta lander, Philae, was attached to the side of the Rosetta spacecraft and released some time after Rosetta achieved orbit around the comet. For more information on Philae, see: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2004-006C.\n\n* Mission Profile\n* ===============\n\nRosetta was launched at 07:17 UT on March 2, 2004 on an Ariane 5 G+ from Kourou, French Guiana. The spacecraft entered heliocentric orbit and had an Earth flyby and gravity assist on March 4, 2005. A Mars flyby/gravity assist followed on February 25, 2007, and two more Earth gravity assists on November 13, 2007 and November 13, 2009. In between these Earth flybys, on September 5, 2008 at 18:58 UTC Rosetta flew within 800 km of asteroid 2867 Steins at a relative velocity of 8.6 km/s. Steins is a main belt E-type asteroid 4.6 km in diameter. After the second Earth flyby, the spacecraft entered the main asteroid belt for the second time and flew by asteroid 21 Lutetia at a distance of 3000 km and a speed of 15 km/s on July 10, 2010. Lutetia is a large asteroid, about 100 km in diameter. The spacecraft entered a hibernation phase in June of 2011. On January 20, 2014, Rosetta came out of hibernation and began its rendezvous manuever for Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko in May 2014. Rosetta made its rendezvous with the comet on August 6, 2014.\n\nThe rendezvous maneuver lowered the spacecraft velocity relative to that of the comet to roughly 25 m/s and put it into the near comet drift phase. Some time after this, observations of the comet and the far approach trajectory phase started. At the end of this approximately 90 day phase, the relative velocity between Rosetta and the comet had been reduced to 2 m/s, at a distance of about 300 comet nucleus radii. At this point, landmarks and radiometric measurements were used to make a precise determination of spacecraft and comet relative positions and velocities and of the rotation and gravity of the comet nucleus to fine-tune the approach. This information was used to start orbit insertion at about 60 comet radii distance at a few cm/s. At about 25 comet radii a capture maneuver closed the orbit. Polar orbits at 5 to 25 comet nucleus radii were used for mapping the nucleus beginning in August 2014.\n\nUsing the information gathered from orbit, a landing site was chosen for the Philae lander. An ejection mechanism separated Philae from the spacecraft with a maximum relative velocity up to 1.5 m/s in November 2014. The lander hit the surface at a relative velocity of about 1 m/s at 15:34 UT on November 12, 2014, but the thruster and harpoons failed and it bounced twice before coming to rest in a shaded area. It transmitted data from the surface to the spacecraft, which relayed it to Earth, until Philae's battery gave out. Last transmission ended at 00:36 UT on November 15th. Eight intermittent contacts were made between the June 13th and July 9th of 2015. The increased heating of the comet forced Rosetta to raise its orbit to a safe distance from the comet nucleus. Following perihelion in August 2015, as the comet moved away from the Sun activity began to diminish and Rosetta was able to lower its orbit again. It moved to a 170 km periapse on November 12, 2015. Attempts at contact with Philae were attempted from this closer position, but were unsuccessful. Rosetta remained in orbit about the comet past perihelion passage on August 13, 2015 and ended the mission on September 30, 2016 with a controlled impact on the comet surface at 11:19 UT.\n\nRosetta was funded by the European Space Agency. The total cost of the mission including launch and operation was about $900 million before the launch delay. The mission was originally to rendezvous with Comet 46 P/Wirtanen. Flybys of two asteroids, 4979 Otawara and 140 Siwa, on the way to the comet were also planned. The mission was delayed due to problems with the Ariane booster. The delay has reportedly cost an extra $70 to $80 million."

The IRM provided multiple ion releases in the solar wind, the magnetosheath, and the magnetotail, with in situ diagnostics of each.\n\nThe IRM spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 15 rpm. Its spin axis was initially in the ecliptic plane, but later it was adjusted with magnetic torquing to be at right angles to the ecliptic. The power system was a 60 W solar array with redundant batteries. There was a redundant S-band telemetry and telecommand system. Telemetry rates could be chosen between 1 and 8 kbps. For injection into the final orbit, the IRM carried its own kick stage. In addition to the ion releases, the instruments on board the spacecraft monitored the ambient, magnetosphere, but with the data acquisition confined to the passes that could be tracked in real time from Germany.\n\nThe spacecraft became inoperational as of 14 August 86. The PI for the German AMPTE Program was G. Haerendel. The release experiment and the diagnostic instruments were each provided by a lead investigator (LI).\n\nFor more details, see B. Hausler et al., IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol. GE-23, p. 192, 1985.\n\nData-taking periods\n\nData was typically taken during about 8 hours per day, while the satellite was visible from the German tracking station Weilheim.\n\nLifetime\n\nAfter launch on 16 August 1984 IRM was taken through the usual commissioning phase and was declared fully operational three weeks later. The spacecraft was then operated until August 1986.\n\nOrbit evolution\n\nAt launch the apogee of the IRM orbit was at a local time of 14:30 hours. As the mission progressed, the IRM apogee precessed to earlier local times at a rate of about 2 hours per month and had completed about 2 complete scans through all local times before the spacecraft ceased operation in August 1986. Thus IRM gave good coverage of all space plasma regions close to the Earth: the solar wind, bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and plasma sheet."

        "Description": "The Giotto mission was designed to study Comet P/Halley. The major objectives of the mission were to:\n\n* 1) Obtain color photographs of the nucleus\n* 2) Determine the elemental and isotopic composition of volatile components in the cometary coma, particularly parent molecules\n* 3) Characterize the physical and chemical processes that occur in the cometary atmosphere and ionosphere\n* 4) Determine the elemental and isotopic composition of dust particles\n* 5) Measure the total gas production rate and dust flux and size to mass ratio distribution and derive the dust to gas ratio\n* 6) Investigate the macroscopic systems of plasma flows resulting from the cometary-solar wind interaction\n\nThe spacecraft encountered the comet on March 13, 1986 at a distance of 0.89 AU from the sun and 0.98 AU from the Earth and an angle of 107\u00b0 from the comet-sun line. The spacecraft was based as much as possible on the ESA GEOstationary Scientific Satellite, GEOS, spacecraft and was spin stabilized with a rate of 15 revolutions per minute, rpm. During the encounter with Halley's comet, the spin axis was aligned with the relative velocity vector. The 1.5 m dish antenna, operating in the X-band, was inclined and despun in order to point at the Earth. The dish was 44\u00b0 with respect to the velocity vector during this phase of the mission. The goal was to come within 500 km of Halley's comet at closest encounter. The actual closest approach was measured at 596 km.\n\nThe main body of Giotto was a short cylinder 1.85 m in diameter by about 1.1 m in length, with three interior platforms. The top platform, 30 cm thick, a main platform, 40 cm thick, and an experiment platform, 30 cm thick. Each platform consisted of a disc within the cylinder on which was mounted subsystem and science apparatus. The cylinder was topped by a tripod that surrounded a high gain dish antenna and gave the spacecraft a total height of 2.85 m. The main rocket was positioned in the center of the cylinder with the nozzle protruding out the bottom. The spacecraft had a dust shield consisting of a front sheet of aluminum, which was 1 mm thick, and a 12 mm Kevlar near sheet separated by 25 cm, which could withstand impacts of particles up to 1 g. The scientific payload was comprised of ten hardware experiments:\n\n* Dust Impact Detector, DID\n* Energetic Particle Analyser, EPA\n* Halley Multicolor Camera, HMC\n* Ion Mass Spectrometer, IMS\n* Magnetometer, MAG\n* Neutral Mass Spectrometer, NMS\n* Optical Probe Experiment, OPE\n* Particle Impact Analyser, PIA\n* Radio Science Experiment, GRE\n* Retarding Potential Analyser, RPA\n* Three-dimensional Positive Ion Analyser, JPA\n\nAll experiments performed well and returned a wealth of new scientific results of which perhaps the most important was the clear identification of the cometary nucleus. Fourteen seconds before closest approach, Giotto was hit by a \"large\" dust particle. The impact caused the spacecraft angular momentum vector to shift by 0.9\u00b0. Following the dust impact, the spacecraft performed a nutation around the new axis with a period of 16 s and an amplitude of 0.9\u00b0. Thus, the maximum deviation from the desired attitude was 1.8\u00b0. Scientific data were received intermittently for the next 32 min. Some experiment sensors suffered damage during this 32 min interval. Other experiments including the camera baffle and deflecting mirror, the dust detector sensors on the front sheet of the bumper shield, and most experiment apertures were exposed to dust particles regardless of the accident and also suffered damage. Many of the sensors survived the encounter with little or no damage. Questionable or partially damaged sensors included the camera, which later proved to not be functional and the Retarding Potential Analyser. Inoperable experiments included the neutral and ion mass spectrometers and one sensor each on the dust detector and the other plasma analyzer, the Three-dimensional Positive Ion Analyser.\n\nDuring the Giotto extended mission, the spacecraft flew by the Earth on July 2, 1990 at a distance of 16,300 km at 10:01:18 UTC. This was the first encounter of Earth by a spacecraft coming from deep space. During the encounter, observations were made of the Earth's magnetic field and energetic particles. Giotto obtained a gravitational assist from this flyby and successfully encountered Comet P/Grigg-Skjellerup on July 10, 1992. The closest approach was 200 km at a relative velocity of 13.99 km/s. The heliocentric distance of the spacecraft was 1.01 AU and the geocentric distance was 1.43 AU at the time of the encounter. The payload was switched on in the evening of July 9th. Eight experiments were operated and provided a surprising wealth of exciting data. The Johnstone Plasma Analyser detected the first presence of cometary ions 600,000 km from the nucleus at 12 h before the closest approach. The Dust Impact Detectors reported the first impact of a fairly large particle at 15:30:56 UT. Bow shocks/waves and acceleration regions were also detected.\n\nOn July 23, 1992 Giotto operations were officially terminated after completion of final orbit adjustments and configuration of the spacecraft for its third hibernation. Only 1 kg to 7 kg of fuel is left on board, which is insufficient for any extensive future maneuvers. Giotto flew by the Earth on July 1, 1999 at a closest approach of about 219,000 km at approximately 02:40 UT, which was at 10:40 pm EDT on June 30th. The spacecraft was moving at about 3.5 km/sec relative to Earth."

Each, with a mass of 25 kg and power 20 W, is octagon-shaped (53 cm x 48 cm). Each is called a \"full service\" satellite, capable of orbit/attitude maneuver and radio links. In all, about 10 innovative, miniaturized technology advances were tested during the 90-day operational span. Among them are variable emittance coatings (to heat when cold and cool when hot), metal oxide logic circuits that can operate at 0.5 volts, miniature magnetometers, and miniature, spinning Sun-sensors.

ST5 provided for the first time simultaneous multi-point measurements of auroral electric currents at low altitudes, which allow us to separate temporal and spatial variations of these currents. ST5 provided a unique data set on the Earth's crustal magnetic field, which is a consequence of both the constellation flying, and the enhanced resolution from the low perigee, lower than any previous geomagnetism mission.\n"

The communications systems is also used to study the solar corona and to search for gravitational waves. Secondary objectives included interplanetary and planetary physics investigations during the initial Earth-Jupiter phase and investigations in the Jovian magnetosphere. The spacecraft used a Jupiter swingby in Feb. 1992 to transfer to a heliospheric orbit with high heliocentric inclination, and will pass over the rotational south pole of the sun in mid-1994 at 2 AU, and over the north pole in mid-1995. A second solar orbit will take Ulysses again over the south and north poles in years 2000 and 2001, respectively. The spacecraft is powered by a single radio-isotope generator. It is spin stabilized at a rate of 5 rpm and its high-gain antenna points continuously to the earth. A nutation anomaly after launch was controlled by CONSCAN. The original mission planned for two spacecraft, one built by ESA and the other by NASA. NASA cancelled its spacecraft in 1981."

        "Description": "The Explorer-class mother spacecraft, International Sun-Earth Explorer 1, was part of the mother/daughter/heliocentric mission (ISEE 1, ISEE 2, ISEE 3). The purposes of the mission were: (1) to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere, (2) to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, (3) to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the plasma sheets, and (4) to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare effects in the interplanetary region near 1 AU. The three spacecraft carried a number of complementary instruments for making measurements of plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields. The mission thus extended the investigations of previous IMP spacecraft. The mother/daughter portion of the mission consisted of two spacecraft (ISEE 1 and ISEE 2) with station-keeping capability in the same highly eccentric geocentric orbit with an apogee of 23 Earth radii. During the course of the mission, the ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 orbit parameters underwent short-term and long-term variations due to solar and lunar perturbations. These two spacecraft maintained a small separation distance, and made simultaneous coordinated measurements to permit separation of spatial from temporal irregularities in the near-Earth solar wind, the bow shock, and inside the magnetosphere. By maneuvering ISEE 2, the inter-spacecraft separation as measured near the Earth's bow shock was allowed to vary between 10 km and 5000 km; its value is accurately known as a function of time and orbital position. The spacecraft were spin stabilized, with the spin vectors maintained nominally within 1 degree of perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, pointing north. The spin rates were nominally 19.75 rpm for ISEE 1 and 19.8 rpm for ISEE 2, so that there was a slow differential rotation between the two spacecraft. The ISEE 1 body-mounted solar array provided approximately 175 watts initially and 131 watts after three years, at 28 volts during normal operation. The ISEE 1 data rate was 4096 bps most of the time and 16384 bps during one orbit out of every five (with some exceptions). Both ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 re-entered the Earth's atmosphere during orbit 1518 on September 26, 1987. Seventeen of 21 on-board experiments were operational at the end. For instrument descriptions written by the investigators, see IEEE Trans. on Geosci. Electron., v. GE-16, no. 3, July 1978."

The sounder used two dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m long). The satellite was spin-stabilized at about 2.9 rpm after antenna deployment. Some control was exercised over the spin rate and attitude by using magnetically induced torques to change the spin rate and to precess the spin axis. A tape recorder with 1-h capacity was included on the satellite. The satellite could be programmed to take recorded observations for four different time periods for each full recording period. The recorder data were dumped only at Ottawa. For non-tape-recorded observations, data for the satellite and subsatellite regions could be acquired and telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of sight of telemetry stations. The selected telemetry stations were in areas that provided primary data coverage near the 80-deg-W meridian and in areas near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, the UK, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Central Africa. NASA support of the ISIS project was terminated on October 1, 1979. A significant amount of experimental data, however, was acquired after this date by the Canadian project team. ISIS 1 operations were terminated in Canada on March 9, 1984. The Radio Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) then requested and received permission to reactivate ISIS 1. Regular ISIS 1 operations were started from Kashima, Japan, in early August 1984. ISIS 1 was deactivated effective January 24, 1990. A data restoration effort began in the late ninties and successfully saved a considerable portion of the high-resolution data before the telemetry tapes were discarted.

        "Description": "The P78-2 (SCATHA - Spacecraft Charging AT High Altitude) was placed into a near synchronous orbit in early February 1979. The objectives of the satellite were twofold; one was to obtain environmental and engineering information so as to provide design criteria, materials, techniques, tests and analytical methods to ensure control of the charging of satellite surfaces. The second objective was to collect scientific data of interest to each experiment sponsor and the scientific community. Key areas of scientific investigation include understanding plasma-wave interactions, substorm studies and further studies of the energetic ring current.\n     \n     The spacecraft was essentially a right circular cylinder, 1.7 m in diameter and 1.8 m high. It had a near-synchronous orbit and spun about the cylinder axis at a rate of 1 rpm. The spin vector was normal to the earth-sun line and in the equatorial plane of the earth. There were three 3-m booms, a 2-m, and a 7-m boom, all for deployment of experiments. In addition, there was a 101.7-m tip-to-tip electric field antenna. An electron gun and a positive ion (xenon) gun were included, to test the control of the spacecraft potential. Telemetry capability was both PCM and FM, and data could be stored up to 12 h using onboard tape recorders. The satellite has its spin axis approximately parallel to the orbit plane and perpendicular to he sun line for 1979-1987 period and perpendicular to ecliptic from 1988 to end of life. This allows good pitch angle coverage by the particle experiments. The experiment complement consists of a complete set of plasma, energetic particle, composition, field and wave experiments.\n     \n  References:\n  * Stevens, J. R. and A. L.

The rocket was dropped at 7:27 p.m. PDT on 27 June 2013 (02:27 UT, 28 June).\n\nIRIS is intended to advance Sun-Earth connection studies by tracing the flow of energy and plasma into the corona and heliosphere for which no suitable observations exist. To achieve this IRIS will obtain high-resolution UV spectra and images of the sun's chromosphere, specifically on the non-thermal energy that creates the corona and the solar wind.\n\nIRIS seeks to determine: (1) the types of non-thermal energy which dominate in the chromosphere and beyond; (2) the means by which the chromosphere regulates mass and energy supply to the corona and heliosphere; and, (3) how magnetic flux and matter rise through the lower solar atmosphere, and the role played by flux emergence in flares and mass ejections. To answer these questions, IRIS will utilize a single intrument, a multi-channel imaging spectrograph. See the experiment description for details on the IRIS instrument."

It was cylindrical, about 4 m long and 2.5 m in diameter. Two solar panels extended from either side of the main body. Mass was about 4 metric tons, with 2.3 metric tons of experiments. The major experiment was a French Sigma coded-mask gamma radiation telescope. It measured 3.5 m by 1.2 m diameter and had a 4.45 by 4.20 deg. field of view. The satellite also carried a spectroscope and an X-ray imaging telescope. The astrophysics payload was developed in cooperation with France, Bulgaria and Denmark. The mission was expected to last 18 months, however, lengthy ground delays may have reduced its on-orbit life to eight months."

Secondary objectives were to make magnetic field and plasma distribution measurements in the solar wind, and to study Type-3 radio emissions caused by solar electron streams in the interplanetary medium. To accomplish these objectives, the spacecraft was instrumented with a plasma wave receiver (VLF), a fluxgate magnetometer (MAG), and a low energy proton-electron differential energy analyzer (LEPEDEA).\n\n\nThe spacecraft was launched on June 3, 1974 into a polar orbit with initial apogee over the north pole and re-entered on April 28, 1978 after 667 orbits or nearly four years of continuous operation. The spacecraft apogee was between 20.28 and 20.92 Earth radii with less than a 1.7 Earth radii perigee. The orbital period was 51.3 hours. During its lifetime, the inclination of the plane of the spacecraft's orbit to the Earth's equator decreased monotonically from 89.81 to 81.85 degrees. The spacecraft was spin stabilized with a nominal rotational period of 11 s. In celestial coordinates, the positive spin axis coordinates were right ascension 299.4 deg (plus or minus 1.1 deg) and declination 8.6 deg (plus or minus 1.5 deg). There was no onboard orientation or spin rate control, but the orientation of the spin axis was stable. An optical aspect system operated from launch until September 3, 1974. After this period, aspect had to be determined from magnetometer measurements. The complete spacecraft with instruments had a mass of 22.65 kg. Power of 22 to 36 W, depending on solar aspect, was obtained from solar cells. Hawkeye 1 participated in the International Magnetospheric Study (IMS) and during the first half of 1977 data acquisition was confined to IMS special intervals. Data were obtained in real time only, at frequencies of 136 MHz and 400 MHz at 100 bps (or 200 bps with convolutional coding) plus wideband VLF data.

DSCOVR will succeed NASA's Advanced Composition Explore's, ACE, role in supporting solar wind alerts and warnings from the L1 orbit, the neutral gravity point between the Earth and sun approximately one million miles from Earth. L1 is a good position from which to monitor the sun, because the constant stream of particles from the sun via the solar wind reaches L1 about an hour before reaching Earth. From this position, DSCOVR will typically be able to provide 15 to 60 minute warning time before the surge of particles and magnetic field, known as a coronal mass ejection, CME, associated with a geomagnetic storm reaches Earth. DSCOVR data will also be used to improve predictions of geomagnetic storm impact locations. Our national security and economic well-being, which depend on advanced technologies, are at risk without these advanced warnings."

Below these were mounted four spherical tanks containing hydrazine for attitude control and, once the main propulsion module had been jettisoned, orbit adjustment. A total of 28 thrusters with twenty-four 50 N thrusters and four 10 N thrusters were mounted on the spherical tanks with additional thrusters mounted on the spacecraft body and solar panels. Attitude was maintained through the use of a three-axis control system with pointing maintained with sun and star sensors.\n\nPhobos 2 operated nominally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phases, gathering data on the Sun, interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. Shortly before the final phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft was to approach within 50 m of surface of Phobos and release two landers, one a mobile \"hopper\" the other a stationary platform, contact with Phobos 2 was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on March 27, 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the on-board computer."

Three orthogonal pairs of dipole antennas were used for the electric fields experiments, and one of these pairs was also used for the radio astronomy experiment. The members of the antenna pair along the spacecraft spin axis extended 2.9 m, the members of the pair used in both the electric field and radio astronomy experiments extended 45.5 m, and the members of the third pair were slightly unbalanced, extending 24.4 and 27.6 m, respectively. All four elements perpendicular to the spin axis were to have extended 45.5 m. The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere October 2, 1974, after a highly successful mission."

The objective of AKEBONO is to investigate the magnetospheric phenomena associated with the acceleration process of aurora particles. Aurora is a luminous phenomenon that occurs when solar-wind particles trapped in the magnetosphere collide with Earth's atmospheric particles. A better understanding of this phenomenon will help us understand the physical processes taking place in the Sun and the reaction on Earth. AKEBONO observes these physical processes to create a greater understanding of the structure of the magnetosphere and the flow and momentum of energy from the Sun through the geospace. AKEBONO is an ambitious satellite carrying a number of \"world-first\" technologies. AKEBONO carries eight sets of instruments for scientific observation. It also has a radiation monitor, and anti-radiation technology that has been applied to a satellite for the first time in the world. This technology provides protection against radiation, even in the near-Earth radiation belt, as it is designed to tolerate about ten times the intensity withstood by conventional satellites. Other world-first technology applied to AKEBONO includes an extension mast for antenna and surface electrical conduction processing, to gain better conductivity and protection from charged particles. The GEOTAIL and NOZOMI satellites have inherited these technologies. GEOTAIL operates in the world-best quiet environment, which has never before been possible without the electromagnetic compatibility test conducted by AKEBONO. AKEBONO has operated for more than 20 years. Although the aurora imager camera has deteriorated due to the severe radioactive environment, all the other instruments are in good order. The direction of the major magnetic field of the Sun is known to reverse in a 22-year cycle. The Sun's activeness, which is typically measured by the number of sunspots, increases and decreases twice in this 22-year cycle. In other words, the Sun's behavior is changing in an 11-year cycle. To study the response of the magnetosphere to various activities of the Sun, we need to acquire data for 22 years. AKEBONO will, therefore, continue its observations.

        "Description": "The Explorer-class heliocentric spacecraft, International Sun-Earth Explorer 3, was part of the mother/daughter/heliocentric mission (ISEE 1, 2, and 3). The purposes of the mission were: (1) to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere; (2) to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere; (3) to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the plasma sheets; and, (4) to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare emissions in the interplanetary region near 1 AU.\n            The three spacecraft carried a number of complementary instruments for making measurements of plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields. The mission thus extended the investigations of previous IMP spacecraft. The launch of three coordinated spacecraft in this mission permitted the separation of spatial and temporal effects. This heliocentric spacecraft had a spin axis normal to the ecliptic plane and a spin rate of about 20 rpm. It was initially placed into an elliptical halo orbit about the Lagrangian libration point (L1) 235 Earth radii on the sunward side of the Earth, where it continuously monitored changes in the near-Earth interplanetary medium. In conjunction with the mother and daughter spacecraft, which had eccentric geocentric orbits, this mission explored the coupling and energy transfer processes between the incident solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere. In addition, the heliocentric ISEE 3 spacecraft also provided a near-Earth baseline for making cosmic-ray and other planetary measurements for comparison with corresponding measurements from deep-space probes. ISEE 3 was the first spacecraft to use the halo orbit.\n            For instrument descriptions written by the investigators, see IEEE Trans. on Geosci. Electron., v. GE-16, no. 3, July 1978.\n            In 1982 ISEE 3 began the magnetotail and comet encounter phases of its mission. A maneuver was conducted on June 10, 1982, to remove the spacecraft from the halo orbit around the L1 point and place it in a transfer orbit involving a series of passages between Earth and the L2 (magnetotail) Lagrangian libration point. After several passes through the Earth's magnetotail, with gravity assists from lunar flybys in March, April, September and October of 1983, a final close lunar flyby (119.4 km above the moon's surface) on December 22, 1983, ejected the spacecraft out of the Earth-Moon system and into a heliocentric orbit ahead of the Earth, on a trajectory intercepting that of Comet Giacobini-Zinner. At this time, the spacecraft was renamed International Cometary Explorer (ICE). A total of fifteen propulsive maneuvers (four of which were planned) and five lunar flybys were needed to carry out the transfer from the halo orbit to an escape trajectory from the earth-moon system into a heliocentric orbit.\n            The primary scientific objective of ICE was to study the interaction between the solar wind and a cometary atmosphere. As planned, the spacecraft traversed the plasma tail of Comet Giacobini-Zinner on September 11, 1985, and made in situ measurements of particles, fields, and waves. It also transited between the Sun and Comet Halley in late March 1986, when other spacecraft (Giotto, Planet-A, MS-T5, VEGA) were also in the vicinity of Comet Halley on their early March comet rendezvous missions. ICE became the first spacecraft to directly investigate two comets. ICE data from both cometary encounters are included in the International Halley Watch archive: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?ds=XD-B3A\n            Tracking and telemetry support have been provided by the DSN (Deep Space Network) since January 1984. The ISEE-3/ICE bit rate was nominally 2048 bps during the early part of the mission, and 1024 bps during the Giacobini-Zinner comet encounter. The bit rate then successively dropped to 512 bps (on 9/12/85), 256 bps (on 5/1/87), 128 bps (on 1/24/89) and finally to 64 bps (on 12/27/91).\n            An update to the ICE mission was approved by NASA headquarters in 1991. It defines a Heliospheric mission for ICE consisting of investigations of coronal mass ejections in coordination with ground-based observations, continued cosmic ray studies, and special period observations such as when ICE and Ulysses are on the same solar radial line. By May 1995 ICE was being operated with only a low duty cycle, with some support being provided by the Ulysses project for data analysis. Two years later, termination of operations of ICE/ISEE3 was authorized May 5, 1997.\n            As of January 1990, ICE was in a 355 day heliocentric orbit with an aphelion of 1.03 AU, a perihelion of 0.93 AU and an inclination of 0.1 degree. This will bring it back to the vicinity of the earth-moon system in August, 2014. For instrument descriptions written by the investigators, see IEEE Trans. on Geosci. Electron., v.

        "Description": "The Explorer-class daughter spacecraft, International Sun-Earth Explorer 2, was part of the mother/daughter/heliocentric mission (ISEE 1, ISEE 2, ISEE 3). The purposes of the mission were: (1) to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere, (2) to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, (3) to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the plasma sheets, and (4) to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare effects in the interplanetary region near 1 AU. The three spacecraft carried a number of complementary instruments for making measurements of plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields. The mission thus extended the investigations of previous IMP spacecraft. The mother/daughter portion of the mission consisted of two spacecraft (ISEE 1 and ISEE 2) with station-keeping capability in the same highly eccentric geocentric orbit with an apogee of 23 Earth radii. During the course of the mission, the ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 orbit parameters underwent short-term and long-term variations due to solar and lunar perturbations. These two spacecraft maintained a small separation distance, and made simultaneous coordinated measurements to permit separation of spatial from temporal irregularities in the near-Earth solar wind, the bow shock, and inside the magnetosphere. By maneuvering ISEE 2, the inter-spacecraft separation as measured near the Earth's bow shock was allowed to vary between 10 km and 5000 km; its value is accurately known as a function of time and orbital position. The spacecraft were spin stabilized, with the spin vectors maintained nominally within 1 degree of perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, pointing north. The spin rates were nominally 19.75 rpm for ISEE 1 and 19.8 rpm for ISEE 2, so that there was a slow differential rotation between the two spacecraft. The ISEE 2 body-mounted solar array supplied approximately 112 watts at launch. The ISEE 2 data rate was 2048 bps most of the time and 8192 bps during one orbit out of every five (with some exceptions). Both ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 re-entered the Earth's atmosphere during orbit 1518 on September 26, 1987. Seventeen of 21 on-board experiments were operational at the end.

Two long crossed-dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m) were used for the sounding, VLF, and cosmic noise experiments. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized to about 2 rpm after antenna deployment. There were two basic orientation modes for the spacecraft, cartwheel and orbit-aligned. The spacecraft operated approximately the same length of time in each mode, remaining in one mode typically 3 to 5 months. The cartwheel mode with the axis perpendicular to the orbit plane was made available to provide ram and wake data for some experiments for each spin period, rather than for each orbit period. Attitude and spin information was obtained from a three-axis magnetometer and a sun sensor. Control of attitude and spin was possible by means of magnetic torquing. The experiment package also included a programmable tape recorder with a 1-h capacity. For nonrecorded observations, data from satellite and subsatellite regions were telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of sight of a telemetry station. Telemetry stations were located so that primary data coverage was near the 80-deg-W meridian and near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, England, France, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Central Africa. NASA support of the ISIS project was terminated on October 1, 1979. A significant amount of experimental data, however, was acquired after this date by the Canadian project team. ISIS 2 operations were terminated in Canada on March 9, 1984. The Radio Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) then requested and received permission to reactivate ISIS 2. Regular ISIS 2 operations were started from Kashima, Japan, in early August 1984. ISIS 2 was deactivated effective 24, 1990. A data restoration effort began in the late ninties and successfully saved a considerable portion of the high-resolution data before the telemetry tapes were discarted.

The scientific objectives of the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer were a detailed study of variations in\n                nitric oxide (NO) in the Earth thermosphere. NO is an important minor constituent that strongly affects the ion composition of the\n                ionosphere and the thermal structure of the thermosphere. Specific objectives were to: (1) determine how variations in the solar\n                soft X-radiation produce changes in the density of nitric oxide in the lower thermosphere; and, (2) determine how auroral activity\n                produces increased nitric oxide in the polar regions. The spacecraft is a compact hexagonal structure, approximately 0.9 m high\n                and 1 m across it widest dimension, weighing a maximum of 100 kg. It was launched into a sun-synchronous circular orbit at\n                530-580 km altitude and 97.7 degrees inclination. It span at 5 rpm with the spin axis normal to the orbit plane and carried\n                three instruments: an ultraviolet spectrometer to measure nitric oxide altitude profiles, a two-channel auroral photometer\n                to measure auroral emissions beneath the spacecraft, and a five-channel solar soft X-ray photometer. SNOE also carried a GPS\n                receiver for accurate orbit and attitude determination.\n\n                The SNOE spacecraft and its instrument complement were designed, built, and operated entirely at the Laboratory for Atmospheric\n                and Space Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n\nSNOE re-entered the atmosphere on 12/13/03 at 09:34Z +/- 6 minutes, descending over 2.9 deg S, 273.8 deg E, on orbit 32248, after 5 years and 290 days.\n"

This includes the physics of\n   the magnetopause magnetospheric boundary regions, the lobe and plasma sheet, and reconnection\n   and neutral line formation, i.e., the mechanisms processes of input, transport, storage,\n   release and conversion of mass, momentum and energy in the magnetotail.\n  \n  \n            Geotail, together with Wind, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster projects, constitute a cooperative\n   scientific satellite project designated the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP)\n   program which aims at gaining improved understanding of the physics of solar-terrestrial relations.\n  \n  \n            Geotail is a spin-stabilized spacecraft utilizing mechanically despun antennas with a design\n   lifetime of about four years.

During the two-year initial phase,\n   the orbit apogee was kept on the nightside of the Earth by using the Moon's gravity\n   in a series of double-lunar swing-by maneuvers that result in the spacecraft spending most of its\n   time in the distant magnetotail (maximum apogee about 200 Earth radii) with a period varying from\n   one to four months. Then, in November 1994, there were a series of maneuvers that reduced the\n   apogee to 50 Re.

The principal objectives are to:\n\n* 1) Determine the three-dimensional structure and dynamical behavior of the rings\n* 2) Determine the composition of the satellite surfaces and the geological history of each object\n* 3) Determine the nature and origin of the dark material on the Iapetus leading hemisphere\n* 4) Measure the three-dimensional structure and dynamical behavior of the magnetosphere\n* 5) Study the dynamical behavior of Cronian atmosphere at cloud level\n* 6) Study the time variability of Titan's clouds and hazes\n* 7) Characterize Titan's surface on a regional scale\n\n* Spacecraft and Subsystems\n* =========================\n\nThe spacecraft was originally planned to be the second three-axis stabilized, radioisotope thermoelectric generator, RTG, powered Mariner Mark II, a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of Mars. However, various budget cuts and rescopings of the project forced a more specialized design, postponing indefinitely any implementation of the Mariner Mark II series.\n\nCassini is the largest interplanetary spacecraft ever constructed by NASA. It measured 6.8 m in length with a 4 m high gain antenna. At launch, the spacecraft had a mass of 5,655 kg of which 3,132 kg were propellant.\n\nThe orientation of Cassini was maintained through the use of either three reaction wheel assemblies mounted along orthogonal axes on the spacecraft, for fine pointing control or via 16 0.5 N thrusters for coarse pointing control. The thrusters were arranged in four groups of four and used hydrazine. The orientation was determined through the use of either three inertial reference units that used solid-state gyroscopes or a star tracker, which detects stars in its field of view and compares them with an on-board catalog of 5,000 stars. The thrusters were also used in the alteration of the spacecraft trajectory of less than 5 m/s. For trajectory corrections of greater than 5 m/s, one of two identical main engines, of which one served as a backup, was used. The engines were gimbaled so that thrust could can be maintained through the spacecraft center of mass and burn the bipropellants nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine.\n\nPower was provided to the spacecraft through the use of three RTGs. Each RTG used the heat generated by the decay of 10.9 kg of plutonium dioxide, PuO2, to generate electrical power to be used throughout the spacecraft. At the beginning of the mission, each RTG was capable of producing 300 W of electrical power. By the end of the nominal 11 yr mission, the output was expected to degrade to around 210 W per RTG. The resultant electricity, a regulated 30 V DC source, was used not only to provide power to the various science instruments and spacecraft subsystems, but also to one-time pyrotechnic devices that were used in the course of the mission, such as to separate the the spacecraft from the Centaur launch vehicle or to separate the Huygens probe from Cassini.\n\nAlthough some data will be transmitted in real time, much science data and spacecraft health and status information were recorded on a solid-state data recorder. Although such systems had been used previously on other missions, Cassini was the first to use one in deep space. The spacecraft was equipped with two recorders, each of which had a capacity of 2 Gb in the form of dynamic random access memory, DRAM. Because such memory is vulnerable to radiation effects, the recorders were encased in half-inch thick aluminum. Nonetheless, degradation of the recorders due to solar and cosmic ray activity was expected to reduce their capacity by about 10% by the end of the mission. Recorded data were then periodically transmitted to Earth via the HGA and erased."

The photos covered 19,000,000 square km of the lunar surface. Photo transmissions by facsimile were returned to Earth from a distance of 2,200,000 km and were retransmitted from a distance of 31,500,000 km (some signals still being transmitted from the distance of the orbit of Mars), thus proving the ability of the communications system. After the lunar flyby, Zond 3 continued space exploration in a heliocentric orbit until the last communications were made in March, 1966 from 153.5 million km distance.\n\nZond 3 had the science objectives of studying the UV and IR spectra of the lunar surface, magnetic properties of near-Earth and interplanetary space, the solar wind, cosmic rays, micrometeorites, and low-frequency galactic radiation. It photographed the remaining 30% of the lunar farside.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe spacecraft design was similar to Zond 2. The Zond 3 station consisted of two hermetically sealed modules, the orbital module and the special module. Mounted on the orbital module were a large parabolic dish antenna for tranmissions, a broad beam receiving antenna, solar panels, hemispherical radiators for thermal control, trajectory correction engines, compressed nitrogen bottles, gas-reaction orientation system engines, optical sensors for the orientation system, and scientific sensors. Housed within the orbital module were the gyroscopes and command, control, orientation, and correction systems, batteries, timers, radio telemetry system, thermal regulation internal heat exchangers, and some scientific equipment. The special module held the phototelevision unit, optical sensor for pointing at the Moon, centimeter waveband radio system, batteries, and the scientific instrument payload. In addition to the imaging equipment it carried a magnetometer, ultraviolet (0.25 - 0.35 micron and 0.19 - 0.27 micron) and infrared (3 - 4 micron) spectrographs, radiation sensors (gas-discharge and scintillation counters), a radiotelescope and a micrometeoroid instrument. It also had an experimental ion engine.\n\nIt is believed that Zond 3 was initially designed as a companion spacecraft to Zond 2 to be launched to Mars during the 1964 launch window. The opportunity to launch was missed, and the spacecraft was launched on a Mars trajectory, although Mars was no longer attainable, as a spacecraft test."

        "Description": "\n      ST5-224 is the last released of the three microsatellites in the Space Technology 5 mission of the American (NASA) New Millennium Program. They were launched at 14:04 UT on 22 March 2006 by a Pegasus XL rocket that was released from the belly of a Lockheed L-1011 plane flying out of Vandenberg AFB. Each, with a mass of 25 kg and power 20 W, is octagon-shaped (53 cm x 48 cm). Each is called a \"full service\" satellite, capable of orbit/attitude maneuver and radio links. In all, about 10 innovative, miniaturized technology advances were tested during the 90-day operational span. Among them are variable emittance coatings (to heat when cold and cool when hot), metal oxide logic circuits that can operate at 0.5 volts, miniature magnetometers, and miniature, spinning Sun-sensors. They orbit in a \"string of pearls\" formation.\n     \n      Approximately 10 min after launch, ejected 3 min apart frisbee-style. Mission duration was 90 days, 7 day launch and early orbit period, mission completed June 20, 2006. The orbit was 105.6 deg inclination (full sun orbit), ~300 km perigee, ~4500 km apogee, 136 minute period.\n     \n     Spacecraft-induced magnetic field effects as measured at the magnetometer\nsensor location less than 10 nT (d.c.), 5 nT (a.c.). The spacecraft carried a science demonstration instrument, a high-resolution, high-precission, three-axis flux-gate magnetometer.\n\n      The ST5 constellation returned unprecedented data on the Earth's auroral currents as well as on the crustal magnetic field. ST5 provided for the first time simultaneous multi-point measurements of auroral electric currents at low altitudes, which allow us to separate temporal and spatial variations of these currents. ST5 provided a unique data set on the Earth's crustal magnetic field, which is a consequence of both the constellation flying, and the enhanced resolution from the low perigee, lower than any previous geomagnetism mission.\n"

        "Description": "The Apollo 12 Lunar Module (LM) \"Intrepid\" was the second crewed vehicle to land on the Moon. It carried two astronauts,\n        Commander Charles P. \"Pete\" Conrad and LM pilot Alan L. Bean, the third and fourth men to walk on the Moon. Also included on the LM was\n        the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) containing scientific experiments to be deployed and left on the lunar surface and\n        other scientific and sample collection apparatus. The experiments performed on the Moon, in addition to the ALSEP suite, were geologic\n        sample collection, surface photography, soil mechanics investigations to study the physical properties of the lunar regolith, the solar\n        wind composition experiment which collected samples of solar wind for return to Earth, and collection of parts of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft.\n\n        Mission Profile\n\n        The LM separated from the Command/Service Module (CSM) at 04:16:03 UT and landed at 06:54:35 UT (1:54:35 a.m. EST) on 19 November 1969\n        in the Oceanus Procellarum area at 3.0124 S latitude, 23.4216 W longitude (IAU Mean Earth Polar Axis coordinate system) within about 180\n        meters of the Surveyor 3 spacecraft, which had landed on April 20, 1967. Conrad and Bean took two moon walks of a total duration of 7\n        hours 45 minutes covering a total traverse distance of 1.35 km. The first was from 11:32:35 to 15:28:38 UT (6:32 a.m. to 10:28 a.m. EST)\n        and involved sample collections in the vicinity of the LM and deployment of the ALSEP and solar wind composition foil collector. The TV\n        camera was inadvertantly pointed towards the Sun when it was being set up and the vidicon tube was damaged rendering the camera inoperable.\n        On the second of these walks, on November 20 from 03:54:45 to 07:44:00 UT (10:54 p.m. Nov. 19 to 2:44 a.m. Nov. 20 EST) they completed a\n        1.3 km geology traverse, collecting samples and taking photographs, and visited the Surveyor 3 spacecraft , bringing back about 10 kg of\n        parts for later examination on Earth. They collected a total of 34.35 kg of rock and soil samples and also collected the solar wind foil.\n        The LM lifted off on 20 November at 14:25:47 UT (9:25 a.m. EST) after spending 31 hours 31 minutes on the Moon. After docking with the CSM\n        (piloted by Richard F. Gordon Jr.) at 17:58:22 UT, the LM was jettisoned at 20:21:30 and intentionally crashed into the Moon, striking at\n        3.94 S, 338.80 E, about 60 km from the seismic station at the Apollo 12 landing site, creating the first recorded artificial moonquake.\n\n        Lunar Module Spacecraft and Subsystems\n\n        The lunar module was a two-stage vehicle designed for space operations near and on the Moon. The spacecraft mass of 15,116 kg was the mass\n        of the LM including astronauts, propellants and expendables. The dry mass of the ascent stage was 2159 kg and it held 2615 kg of propellant.\n        The descent stage dry mass was 2211 kg and 8131 kg of propellant were onboard initially. The ascent and descent stages of the LM operated as\n        a unit until staging, when the ascent stage functioned as a single spacecraft for rendezvous and docking with the command and service module\n        (CSM). The descent stage comprised the lower part of the spacecraft and was an octagonal prism 4.2 meters across and 1.7 m thick. Four\n        landing legs with round footpads were mounted on the sides of the descent stage and held the bottom of the stage 1.5 m above the surface.\n        The distance between the ends of the footpads on opposite landing legs was 9.4 m. One of the legs had a small astronaut egress platform and\n        ladder. A one meter long conical descent engine skirt protruded from the bottom of the stage. The descent stage contained the landing rocket,\n        two tanks of aerozine 50 fuel, two tanks of nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, water, oxygen and helium tanks and storage space for the lunar\n        equipment and experiments, and in the case of Apollo 15, 16, and 17, the lunar rover. The descent stage served as a platform for launching\n        the ascent stage and was left behind on the Moon.\n\n        The ascent stage was an irregularly shaped unit approximately 2.8 m high and 4.0 by 4.3 meters in width mounted on top of the descent stage.\n        The ascent stage housed the astronauts in a pressurized crew compartment with a volume of 6.65 cubic meters. There was an ingress-egress\n        hatch in one side and a docking hatch for connecting to the CSM on top. Also mounted along the top were a parabolic rendezvous radar antenna,\n        a steerable parabolic S-band antenna, and 2 in-flight VHF antennas. Two triangular windows were above and to either side of the egress hatch\n        and four thrust chamber assemblies were mounted around the sides. At the base of the assembly was the ascent engine. The stage also contained\n        an aerozine 50 fuel and an oxidizer tank, and helium, liquid oxygen, gaseous oxygen, and reaction control fuel tanks. There were no seats in\n        the LM. A control console was mounted in the front of the crew compartment above the ingress-egress hatch and between the windows and two\n        more control panels mounted on the side walls. The ascent stage was launched from the Moon at the end of lunar surface operations and\n        returned the astronauts to the CSM.\n\n        The descent engine was a deep-throttling ablative rocket with a maximum thrust of about 45,000 N mounted on a gimbal ring in the center of\n        the descent stage. The ascent engine was a fixed, constant-thrust rocket with a thrust of about 15,000 N. Maneuvering was achieved via the\n        reaction control system, which consisted of the four thrust modules, each one composed of four 450 N thrust chambers and nozzles pointing\n        in different directions. Telemetry, TV, voice, and range communications with Earth were all via the S-band antenna. VHF was used for\n        communications between the astronauts and the LM, and the LM and orbiting CSM. There were redundant tranceivers and equipment for both\n        S-band and VHF. An environmental control system recycled oxygen and maintained temperature in the electronics and cabin. Power was provided\n        by 6 silver-zinc batteries. Guidance and navigation control were provided by a radar ranging system, an inertial measurement unit consisting\n        of gyroscopes and accelerometers, and the Apollo guidance computer.\n\n        Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP)\n\n        The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) consisted of a set of scientific instruments emplaced at the landing site by the\n        astronauts. The instruments were arrayed around a central station which supplied power to run the instruments and communications so data\n        collected by the experiments could be relayed to Earth. The central station was a 25 kg box with a stowed volume of 34,800 cubic cm.\n        Thermal control was achieved by passive elements (insulation, reflectors, thermal coatings) as well as power dissipation resistors and\n        heaters. Communications with Earth were achieved through a 58 cm long, 3.8 cm diameter modified axial-helical antenna mounted on top of\n        the central station and pointed towards Earth by the astronauts. Transmitters, receivers, data processors and multiplexers were housed\n        within the central station. Data collected from the instruments were converted into a telemetry format and transmitted to Earth. The\n        ALSEP system and instruments were controlled by commands from Earth. The uplink frequency for all Apollo mission ALSEP's was 2119 MHz,\n        the downlink frequency for the Apollo 12 ALSEP was 2278.5 MHz.\n\n        Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)\n\n        The SNAP-27 model RTG produced the power to run the ALSEP operations. The generator consisted of a 46 cm high central cylinder and eight\n        radiating rectangular fins with a total tip-to-tip diameter of 40 cm. The central cylinder had a thinner concentric inner cylinder inside,\n        and the two cylinders were attached along their surfaces by 442 spring-loaded lead-telluride thermoelectric couples mounted radially along\n        the length of the cylinders. The generator assembly had a total mass of 17 kg. The power source was an approximately 4 kg fuel capsule in\n        the shape of a long rod which contained plutonium-238 and was placed in the inner cylinder of the RTG by the astronauts on deployment.\n        Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 89.6 years and produces heat. This heat would conduct from the inner cylinder to the outer via the\n        thermocouples which would convert the heat directly to electrical power. Excess heat on the outer cylinder would be radiated to space by the\n        fins. The RTG produced approximately 70 W DC at 16 V. (63.5 W after one year.) The electricity was routed through a cable to a power\n        conditioning unit and a power distribution unit in the central station to supply the correct voltage and power to each instrument.\n\n        ALSEP Scientific Instruments\n\n        All ALSEP instruments were deployed on the surface by the astronauts and attached to the central station by cables. The Apollo 12 ALSEP\n        instruments consisted of: (1) a passive seismometer, designed to measure seismic activity and physical properties of the lunar crust and\n        interior; (2) a suprathermal ion detector, designed to measure the flux, composition, energy, and velocity of low-energy positive ions;\n        (3) a cold cathode ion gauge, designed to measure the atmosphere and any variations with time or solar activity such atmosphere may have;\n        (4) a lunar dust detector, to measure dust accumulation, radiation damage to solar cells, and reflected infrared energy and temperatures;\n        (5) a lunar surface magnetometer (LSM), designed to measure the magnetic field at the lunar surface; and (6) a solar wind spectrometer,\n        which measured the fluxes and spectra of the electrons and protons that emanate from the Sun and reach the lunar surface. The central\n        station, located at 3.0094 S latitude, 23.4246 W longitude, was turned on at 14:21 UT on 19 November 1969 and shut down along with the\n        other ALSEP stations on 30 September 1977.\n"

        "Description": "Demonstration and Science Experiments(DSX) Satellite When launched in 2008, the Demonstration\n   and Science Experiments (DSX) spacecraft will conduct basic research designed to significantly advance\n   Dept. of Defense capability to operate in the harsh radiation environment of medium earth orbit (MEO).\n   The ability to operate effectively in the MEO environment significantly increases the DOD capability to\n   field space systems that provide persistent global targeting grade space surveillance, high speed,\n   satellite based communication, lower cost global positioning system navigation and protection from\n   space weather on a responsive satellite platform. The three DSX experiments areas are: (1) Wave\n   Particle Interaction Experiment (WPIx), which will research the physics of very low frequency (VLF)\n   transmissions in the magnetosphere and characterize the capability of natural and man made VLF waves\n   to reduce space radiation (2) Space Weather Experiment (SWx), which will characterize and model the\n   space radiation environment in MEO, an orbital regime attractive for future DOD and commercial missions\n   (3) Space Environmental Effects (SEE), which will investigate and characterize the space weather effects\n   on spacecraft electronics and materials DSX uses a modular structure design that allows for launch either\n   as a primary satellite on a conventional launcher like the Minotaur, or as a secondary payload on a\n   larger rocket such as the evolved expendable launch vehicle (EELV). For the EELV launch scenario, the\n   EELV secondary payload adapter (ESPA) ring is upgraded to provide host spacecraft functions with the\n   addition of a host spacecraft bus (HSB). The experiment payloads are located in a payload module attached\n   to the ring opposite the HSB. Unlike the traditional ESPA approach, where individual satellites\n   separate from the ESPA ring to become free flyers, DSX's HSB and payload module remain attached to the\n   ring and are deployed as a single integrated spacecraft. For launch on a dedicated rocket, the HSB\n   and payload module are removed from the ESPA and are directly attached to one another in a stacked\n   configuration. DSX is baselined to be ready for launch in October 2008 and is seeking an elliptical\n   orbit of 6,000 by 12,000 kilometers with a mid inclination. In addition, the spacecraft is designed\n   for one year of orbital operations. The WPIx will transmit and receive VLF waves in the 10 to 50\n   kilohertz range, and quantify their effect on the trapped electron populations in the magnetosphere.\n   In addition, DSX will use ground transmitters and other space receivers to measure critical parameters\n   such as VLF injection across the ionosphere and the far field radiated patterns. The SWx will characterize\n   the high and low energy electron and proton fluence, radiation dose rates, local magnetic fields and pitch\n   angle distribution in the ''slot region'' orbit located near an altitude of 10,000 kilometers, between the\n   inner and outer Van Allen radiation belts. It is an attractive orbit for future communications and\n   surveillance satellites because it has a low radiation dose rate and sufficient altitude to allow\n   for global coverage, but yet is four times closer than geostationary (GEO) satellites, which increases\n   communications speed by a factor of eight. This attractive orbit has remained largely unexplored,\n   with most commercial, military, and science satellites opting for low earth orbit (LEO) or GEO orbits.\n   The SEE consists of NASA's Space Environment Testbed (SET) and several AFRL developed photometers and\n   radiometers. SET features four smaller experiments designed to investigate radiation effects on\n   electronics such as field programmable gate arrays and linear devices. The AFRL instruments will\n   directly measure the radiation induced degradation of the optical and thermal properties for several\n   spacecraft materials of interest. DSX will benefit the warfighter by significantly enhancing understanding\n   of the MEO environment, with particular emphasis on the ''slot region,'' which is attractive for future\n   space surveillance and high speed communication. In addition, DSX will perform the basic research\n   needed to assess the DOD's ability to actively regulate agitations to the space weather environment\n   that currently cause accelerated degradation of critical space assets.\n"

Wind is cylindrical, approximately 2.8 m in diameter by 1.25 m high, with body-mounted solar cells. It has long wire spin-plane antennas, inertial booms, and spin-plane appendages to support sensors. Wind has experiment booms deployed along both Z axes. The spin rate is 20 rpm around an axis within 1 degree of normal to the ecliptic.\n            Data are stored using on-board tape recorders and are relayed to the Deep Space Network at one of two rates: 5.5 or 11.1 kbps.\n            For the first nine months of operation, Wind was placed in a double-lunar swingby orbit near the ecliptic plane, with apogee from 80 to 250 Earth radii and perigee of between 5 and 10 Earth radii. In this orbit, lunar gravity assists were used to keep its apogee over the day hemisphere of the Earth, and magnetospheric observations are made. Wind was then inserted into a small \"halo\" orbit, about the sunward Sun-Earth gravitational equilibrium point (L1), varying from 235 to 265 Earth radii. In this orbit Wind measures the incoming solar wind, magnetic fields and particles continuously and provides an approximately one-hour warning to the other ISTP spacecraft of changes in the solar wind.\n            In 2001 and 2002 Wind has executed a distant prograde orbit that took it +/- 300 Re leading and legging Earth. This orbit provided a wide baseline to study solar wind structures and correlations. In 2003, Wind reached the L2 Lagrange point 240 Re anti-sunward from Earth providing a 500 Re spatial separation from ACE solar wind observations along with measurements of the distant Earth magnetotail. Since 2004, Wind has been permanently parked in a L1 halo orbit where it continues to provide high-quality solar wind measurements."

In addition, the following investigations were included: three solar flare X-ray monitors that recorded the time profile and spectrum of the X-ray flares in the range 2 to 20 keV, a solar flare gamma-ray detector for the range 0.2 to 9.0 MeV, a particle detector that monitored electron flux above 100 keV, and plasma probes for the measurement of electron density and temperature."

        "Description": "The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) was launched into a geosynchronous\n   transfer orbit (GTO) for a nominal three-year mission to investigate fields, plasmas, and energetic particles\n   inside the Earth's magnetosphere. As part of the CRRES program the SPACERAD (Space Radiation Effects) project,\n   managed by Air Force Geophysics Laboratory, investigated the radiation environment of the inner and outer\n   radiation belts and measured radiation effects on state-of-the-art microelectronics devices. Other\n   magnetospheric, ionospheric, and cosmic ray experiments were included onboard CRRES and supported by NASA or\n   the Office of Naval Research. The chemical release project was managed by NASA/MSFC and utilized the release of\n   chemicals from onboard cannisters at low altitudes near dawn and dusk perigee times and at high altitudes near\n   local midnight. The chemical releases were monitored with optical and radar instrumentation by ground-based\n   observers to measure the bulk properties and movement of the expanding clouds of photo-ionized plasma along\n   field lines after the releases occurred. In order to study the magnetosphere at different local times during\n   the mission, the satellite orbit was designed to precess with respect to the earth-sun line such that the local\n   time at apogee decreased by 2.5 minutes/day from 08:00 (LT) just after launch and returned to this position in\n   nineteen-month cycles. The CRRES spacecraft had the shape of an octagonal prism with solar arrays on the top\n   side. The prism is 1 m high and 3 m between opposite faces. Four of the eight compartments were for the chemical\n   canisters and the other four housed SPACERAD and other experiments. The spacecraft body was spun at 2.2 rpm about\n   a spin axis in the ecliptic plane and kept pointed about 12 degrees ahead of the Sun's apparent motion in\n   celestial coordinates. Pre-launch and in-flight operations were supported by the Space Test and Transportation\n   Program Office of the U.S. Air Force Space Division. Contact with the CRRES spacecraft was lost on October 12,\n   1991 and was presumed to be due to onboard battery failure."

        "Description": "Explorer 31 was a small ionospheric observatory instrumented to make direct measurements of selected ionospheric parameters at the spacecraft. It carried seven experiments: a thermal ion experiment, a thermal electron experiment, an electrostatic probe, an electron temperature probe, a spherical mass spectrometer, an energetic electron current monitor, and a magnetic ion-mass spectrometer. Since the spacecraft had no tape recorder, data could be observed at the spacecraft only when the spacecraft was in sight of the telemetry station and when commanded on. Experiments were operated either simultaneously or sequentially, as desired. The satellite was spin-stabilized with the spin axis perpendicular to the orbit plane. The spin rate and spin axis were controlled by an onboard magnetic torquing system. The attitude and spin rate information were observed by a sun sensor and a three-axis magnetometer. Satellite performance was satisfactory except for a partial power failure in May 1966, which reduced data acquisition time to about half the nominal amount. Some difficulties were encountered in obtaining attitude information that was necessary for the reduction of the experiment observations. On July 1, 1969, the satellite data observations were terminated with five of the seven experiments operating. Responsibility for standby monitoring of the satellite was given to the ESSA telemetry station at Boulder, Colorado, on July 8, 1969. During this standby operation, experiment data were collected only once on October 1, 1969, for 9 min from the electrostatic probe for use in studying a red arc event. On January 15, 1971, no response was received from a variety of satellite commands, and the satellite was abandoned."

Its primary science objectives are to: (1) follow the evolution of magnetic field structures from the solar interior to the corona; (2) investigate the mechanisms of the heating of the outer solar atmosphere; and, (3) determine the triggers and onset of solar flares and mass ejections. TRACE is a single-instrument, three-axis stabilized spacecraft. The spacecraft attitude control system (ACS) utilizes three magnetic-torquer coils, a digital sun sensor, six coarse sun sensors, a three-axis magnetometer, four reaction wheels, and three two-axis inertial gyros to maintain pointing. In science mode the spacecraft uses an instrument-provided guide telescope as a fine guidance sensor to provide a pointing accuracy of less than 5 arc-seconds. Power is provided to the spacecraft through the use of four panels of Ga-As solar cells with a total area of 2.0 square-meters. The solar array actually produces power of around 220 W, 85 W of which is used each orbit by the spacecraft and 35 W of which is used by the instrument each orbit. The remaining power is used for operational and decontamination heating of the spacecraft and telescope. A 9 A-hour Ni-Cd battery provides energy during time when the spacecraft is in the Earth's shadow. Communications are provided via a 5 W S-band transponder, providing up to 2.25 Mbps downlink data transmission and 2 kbps uplink. Data are transmitted up to six times daily. Data are stored on-board using a solid-state recorder capable of holding up to 300 MB. The command and data handling system uses a 32-bit 80386/80387 processor."

The Swedish Line of Microsatellites had given the institute the Inspiration and Experience needed to design, together with the Students of the Space Engineering Programme of Umea University, RYP, a \"Nanosatellite\". From the very beginning the Plans were to have a firm Scientific Goal with the Satellite, soon to be named Munin after one of the God Odins Ravens.  The Scientific Objective with Munin is to collect Data on the Auroral Activity on both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, such that a Global Picture of the Current State of Activity can be made available Online. The Data acquired by Munin will then serve as an Input to the Prediction of Space Weather. Student Projects involving the Processing and Reduction of the Data is foreseen.  Using Modern Technology, a very small Satellite can be built and still have the necessary Functions needed to support a specific Scientific Mission. The Goal of the Munin Project is both to achieve the Scientific Objectives, and to show that it is possible to achieve them with a very small Satellite. The approximately 5 kg Satellite will have a combined Electron and Ion Spectrometer, an Instrument first to be flown on the Swedish Astrid-2 Mission. The Spectrometer, called MEDUSA, is built by Southwest Research Institute, SwRI. In addition, the Satellite will measure High Energy Particles with a Solid State Detector, and Image the Aurora with a Miniature CCD Camera. The Satellite has a Passive Attitude Control System by using a Magnet and Oscillation Dampers. Silicon Solar Cells and a Li-Ion Battery provide the needed Power. The Satellite uses the UHF-Band for the Uplink and Downlink to the Ground Station located at the Institute in Kiruna. Digital Signal Processors perform Instrument Control, Data Compression and Telemetry Formatting, as well as serving as a Software Modem. A Separation System has been developed by Staff and Ph.D. Students in Mechanical Engineering at the Lulea University of Technology, LUTH.  The Name of the Satellite comes from Nordic Mythology: \"The Ravens Munin and Hugin flew out and brought back News from every Corner of the World. Sitting on the God Odin's Shoulders, They whispered all the News in his Ears. Munin represented the Memory and Hugin the Intelligence... and They were his embodied Soul...\""

The apogee was high enough to permit measurements above the interaction regions of suprathermal ions, and also plasma flow measurements at the feet of the magnetospheric field lines. The general form of the spacecraft was a short polygon 137 cm in diameter and 115 cm high. The triaxial antennas were 23 m tip-to-tip. One 6-m boom was provided for remote measurements. The spacecraft weight was 403 kg. Power was supplied by a solar cell array, which charged two 6-ampere-hour nickel-cadmium batteries. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized with the yaw axis aligned toward the center of the earth to within 1 deg. The spin axis was normal to the orbit plane within 1 deg with a spin rate of one revolution per orbit. A single-axis scan platform was included in order to mount the low-altitude plasma instrument (81-070B-08). The platform rotated about the spin axis. A pulse code modulation telemetry data system was used that operated in real time or in a tape-recorder mode. Data were acquired on a science-problem-oriented basis, with closely coordinated operations of the various instruments, both satellites, and supportive experiments. Measurements were temporarily stored on tape recorders before transmission at an 8:1 playback-to-record ratio. Since commands were also stored in a command memory unit, spacecraft operations were not real time. Additional details can be found in R. A. Hoffman et al., Space Sci. Instrum., v. 5, n. 4, p. 349, 1981. DE-2 reentered the atmosphere on February 19, 1983."

TIMED investigates a region that is difficult to study because it is too high for even the largest research balloons and still dense enough to quickly cause a satellite to decay from orbit. Because of the lack of measurements this atmospheric region is often referred to as the \"ignorosphere\". Absorping a considerable amount of solar ultraviolet radiation from the sun and intercepting high energy atomic particles, this region is the \"skin\" between the life-sustaining lower layers and outer space. Originally proposed as a two-spacecraft mission, the TIMED project was rescoped to a one-satellite mission due to budgetary pressure. TIMED was downsized to a core mission of four experiments and six interdisciplinary investigations and mission management was moved to JHU-APL in an effort to reduce the cost to the $100M level. The instruments include the Solar EUV Experiment (SEE) provided by the University of Colorado, the TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI) provided by the University of Michigan, the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) provided by the Aerospace Corp., and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) provided by NASA's Langley Research Center. TIMED was launched together with Jason 1 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB on 7 December 2001. All instruments are fully operational, only the TIDI instrument is operating with somewhat decreased sensitivity because of a light leak and ice deposits on the instrument optics."

        "Description": "OGO 4 was a large observatory instrumented with experiments designed to study the interrelationships between the aurora and airglow emissions, energetic particle activity, geomagnetic field variation, ionospheric ionization and recombination, and atmospheric heating which take place during a period of increased solar activity. OGO 4 consisted of a main body, generally parallelepipedal in form, two rectangular solar panels each including a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), and two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP). The main body was attitude controlled by use of horizon scanners and gas jets and was designed to be pointed toward the earth (Z axis). The axis connecting the two solar panels (X axis) was designed to oscillate so as to remain perpendicular to the earth-sun-spacecraft plane. The solar panels, activated by sun sensors, could rotate about this X axis to obtain maximum radiation for the solar cells and, concurrently, orient the SOEP properly. The OPEPs were mounted on either end of an axis which was parallel to the Z axis and attached to the forward end of the main body. The OPEP sensors normally were maintained looking forward in the orbital plane of the satellite. To maintain this orientation, the OPEP axis could rotate over 90 deg, and, in addition, an angular difference of over 90 deg was possible between the orientation of the upper and lower OPEP packages. The SOEP contained four experiments, and the OPEP contained five experiments. After the spacecraft achieved orbit and the experiments were deployed into an operating mode, an attitude control problem occurred. This condition was corrected by ground control procedures until complete failure of the tape recording systems in mid-January 1969. At that time, due to the difficulty of maintaining attitude control without the tape recorders, the attitude control system was commanded off, and the spacecraft was placed into a spin-stabilized mode about the axis which was previously maintained vertically. Initial spin period was 202 s with the mean spin axis approximately perpendicular to the orbit plane (spin period as of March 12, 1969, was 217 s). The precession period of the mean spin axis was about 5 days. In this mode, seven of the remaining experiments were turned off since no meaningful data could be observed by them. On October 23, 1969, the satellite was turned off. It was reactivated again in January 1970 for 2 months to obtain VLF observations. For additional information see J. E. Jackson and J.I. Vette, OGO Program Summary, NASA SP-7601, December 1975."

The Skylab was in the form of a cylinder, with the ATM being positioned 90 deg from the longitudinal axis after insertion into orbit. The ATM was a solar observatory, and it provided attitude control and experiment pointing for the rest of the cluster. It was attached to the MDA and AM at one end of the OWS. The retrieval and installation of film used in the ATM was accomplished by astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVA). The MDA served as a dock for the command and service modules, which served as personnel taxis to the Skylab. The AM provided an airlock between the MDA and the OWS, and contained controls and instrumentation. The IU, which was used only during launch and the initial phases of operation, provided guidance and sequencing functions for the initial deployment of the ATM, solar arrays, etc. The OWS was a modified Saturn 4B stage suitable for long duration manned habitation in orbit. It contained provisions and crew quarters necessary to support three-person crews for periods of up to 84 days each. All parts were also capable of unmanned, in-orbit storage, reactivation, and reuse. The Skylab itself was launched on May 14, 1973. It was first manned during the period May 25 to June 22, 1973, by the crew of the SL-2 mission (73-032A). Next, it was manned during the period July 28 to September 25, 1973, by the crew of the SL-3 mission (73-050A).

The main body of the spacecraft, comprised of the electronics bays, propellant system, RTG and science booms, and high-gain antenna, rotates at revolutions per minute, rmp, rates of eithe 3.25 or 10.5. The despun section, aft of the main body, uses an electric motor to drive it counter to the rotation of the main section. This dual spin attitude control system accommodates imaging instruments which require stable, accurate pointing and the various particles and fields instruments that benefit from repetitive, broad-angular coverage. The length of the spacecraft is 9 m and, with the high-gain antenna, HGA, deployed, is 4.6 m in diameter.\n\nPower is provided to the spacecraft through the use of two radioisotope thermal generators, RTGs, each of which is located at the end of a short boom. The magnetometer sensors and plasma wave antenna are located on yet another boom, 10.9 m in length.\n\nAlthough it was intended that communications with the Deep Space Network, DSN, would be primarily through the HGA, which would remain pointing toward the Earth at all times, thermal constraints forced the use of the two low-gain antennas prior to the first Earth flyby. HGA deployment was planned thereafter, but at least three of the HGA \"ribs\" were unable to be moved much beyond their launch configurations, thereby jeopardizing the total science return of the mission. Several attempts have been made to deploy the antenna through a variety of techniques.\n\n* Quick Facts\n* ===========\n\n* Spacecraft\n* ==========\n\n* Dimensions: 5.3 m (17 ft) high\n* The magnetometer boom extends 11 m (36 ft) to one side\n* Weight: 2,223 kg (2.5 tons, or 4,902 lb), including 118 kg (260 lb) of science instruments and 925 kg (2040 lb) of propellant\n* Power: 570 watts at launch from radioisotope thermoelectric generators\n\nScience instruments:\n\n* Solid-state imaging camera\n* Near-infrared mapping spectrometer\n* Ultraviolet spectrometer\n* Photopolarimeter radiometer\n* Magnetometer\n* Energetic particles detector\n* Plasma investigation\n* Plasma wave subsystem\n* Dust detector\n* Heavy ion counter\n\n* Atmospheric Probe\n* =================\n\n* Size: 127 cm (50 in) diameter, 91 cm (36 in) high\n* Weight: 339 kg (750 lb)\n\nScience instruments: Atmospheric structure\n\n* Neutral mass spectrometer\n* Helium abundance nephelometer\n* Net flux radiometer\n* Lightning/energetic particles\n* Doppler wind experiment\n\n* Mission\n* =======\n\n* Launch: Oct. 18, 1989 from Kennedy Space Center, Fla., on space shuttle Atlantis on mission STS-34\n* End of Mission: Sep. 21, 2003\n* Primary mission: October 1989 to December 1997\n* Extended missions: Three, from 1997 to 2003\n* Venus flyby: Feb. 10, 1990, at altitude of 16,000 km (10,000 mi)\n* Earth flybys: Dec. 8, 1990, at altitude of 960 km (597 mi); Dec. 8, 1992 at altitude of 303 km (188 mi)\n* Asteroid Gaspra flyby: Oct. 29, 1991, at 1,601 km (1,000 mi)\n* Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9: Impacts of comet fragments into Jupiter observed while en route in July 1994\n* Asteroid Ida flyby: Aug. 28, 1993, at 2,400 km (1,400 mi)\n* Atmospheric probe release: July 12, 1995\n* Probe speed into Jupiter's atmosphere: 47.6 km per second (106,000 mi per hour) Jupiter arrival and orbit insertion: Dec. 7, 1995\n* Probe atmospheric entry and relay: Dec. 7, 1995\n* Number of Jupiter orbits during entire mission: 34\n* Number of flybys of Jupiter moons: Io 7, Callisto 8, Ganymede 8, Europa 11, Amalthea 1\n\n* Mission Overview\n* ================\n\nThe Galileo mission utilizes a single launch of a combined Orbiter and Probe using the space shuttle Atlantis and an inertial upper stage, IUS, to inject the Galileo spacecraft on its interplanetary trajectory to Jupiter. The launch window occurs from October 12, 1989 to November 21, 1989. Since the IUS does not have the energy to inject Galileo on a direct trajectory to Jupiter, the spacecraft will instead be launched first towards Venus for the first leg of its Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assist, VEEGA, trajectory to Jupiter. Target-of-opportunity science observations will be made at Venus, closest approach February 10, 1990, the first Earth encounter, closest approach to Earth and Moon December 8, 1990, the asteroid Gaspra, closest approach October 29, 1991, the second Earth encounter, closest approach to Earth and Moon December 8, 1992, and the asteroid Ida, closest approach August 28, 1993.\n\nAt about 150 days before Galileo arrives at Jupiter, the Probe is separated from the Orbiter. From this moment in time, the Probe is on a ballistic trajectory to the Probe entry point, about 6 degrees north latitude, into the atmosphere of Jupiter. Using its 400 Newton engine for the first time, the Orbiter executes an Orbiter deflection maneuver to keep from following the Probe into the atmosphere of Jupiter, and to retarget the Orbiter to the proper encounter conditions required for the Jupiter Orbit Insertion phase of the mission.\n\nA close flyby at an altitude of about 1,000 km of the Jovian satellite Io occurs in this phase for the purpose of science observations as well as to slow the Orbiter down relative to Jupiter by nearly 200 m/s in order to reduce the propellant required during the Jupiter Orbit Insertion, JOI, 400 Newton engine burn to capture Galileo into Jupiter's orbit. Perijove of about 4 Rj occurs about 4 hours after Io encounter. A few minutes after perijove passage, the Probe entry and beginning of the relay of data from the Probe to the Orbiter occurs.\n\nThe Probe mission and data relay lasts 75 min, after which JOI is performed, slowing the Orbiter down relative to Jupiter by about 630 m/s. The initial orbit period is about 200 days. A large 400 Newton engine burn is performed at the first apojove in order to raise perijove from 4 Rj to about 9 Rj thus allowing at least 11 orbits with 10 targeted satellite encounters to be completed by the Orbiter without exceeding the allowed total accumulated radiation exposure at the spacecraft. Only three orbits would be allowed before exceeding this limit if perijove were allowed to stay at 4 Rj where the radiation environment is very severe. Also during this perijove raise maneuver, Galileo is targeted to the satellite Ganymede, the first of its Galilean satellite encounters following JOI.\n\nAt this point, the targeting to satellite encounters begins, such that a satellite tour consisting of a minimum of 10 targeted satellite encounters is achieved within the 23 month period allotted for the satellite tour. During the course of the satellite tour, the orientation, shape and size of the spacecraft orbits around the Jovian system, referred to as petals because of how the spacecraft orbits appear on a plan view of the Jovian satellite tour trajectory, is controlled almost exclusively by gravity assists of the satellites themselves. The orbit periods are pumped down by successive encounters with the satellites from the initial 200 days to approximately 35-40 days between encounters. At the 8th orbit, when the orbit petal orientation is approximately in the anti-sun direction, the period is again pumped up to about 100 days, allowing one of the primary objectives, probing the Jovian magnetotail, to be accomplished. After this magnetotail orbit, the period is again pumped down, by gravity assist encounters with the Jovian satellites, to 35-40 days for the final 2-3 targeted encounters."

        "Description": "The AMPTE (Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers) mission was designed to study the access of solar wind ions to the magnetosphere, the convective-diffusive transport and energization of magnetospheric particles, and the interactions of plasmas in space.\n\nThe program consisted of three spacecraft: the CCE, which measured in the magnetosphere the ions released by the IRM; the IRM, which provided multiple ion releases in the solar wind, the magnetosheath, and the magnetotail, with in situ diagnostics of each; and the UKS. The UKS was one spacecraft of the AMPTE (Active Magnetosphere Particle Tracer Experiment) program (along with CCE and IRM) and served as a subsatellite of the IRM spacecraft. Its purpose was to help distinguish between spatial structure and temporal changes in the plasma phenomena initiated by ion releases from the IRM and in the natural magnetospheric environment. Measured quantities were similar to those of the IRM and include magnetic fields, positive ions, electrons, plasma waves, and modulations in ions and electrons.\n\nThe spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 12 rpm and employed S-band communications. It carried a cold gas propulsion system and a VHF radar system for station keeping with the IRM normally at a distance of a few hundred kilometers. The lead investigator for the UKS spacecraft was D. A. Bryant.\n\nFor more details, see A.K. Ward, et al., IEEE Transaction on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol. GE-23, p 202, 1985.\n\nData-taking periods\n\nThe operation of UKS was constrained by the power available from the solar panels and onboard battery capacity. This limited operation of the full set of instruments to a maximum duration of 5 hours after which 10 hours were required to recharge batteries. Longer periods of operation were possible with a subset of the instruments. Operation was further constrained by the need to transmit data back to the ground in real-time. Thus, in general, the instruments were operated only when the spacecraft was in view of the telemetry stations in the UK (but on a few special occasions, such as ion releases, this constraint was overcome by use of the NASA Deep Space Network). As a result, the UKS data are discontinuous with coverage of up to 6 hours per day.\n\nNote that the database contains data for most, but not all, of the data-taking periods. Some data are omitted because of problems in processing.\n\nLifetime\n\nAfter launch on 16 August 1984 UKS was taken through the usual commissioning phase and was declared fully operational on 25 August 1984. The spacecraft was then operated almost every day up to and including 15 January 1985 when the spacecraft power supply failed. Telemetry contact could not be established when it came into view of the ground station on 16 January or on several later attempts.\n\nControl\n\nThe spacecraft was operated in real-time from a control center located at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. A duty scientist, selected for each day from the instrument teams, was responsible for operational decisions within a strategy set primarily by the UK Science Team. These decisions were typically to select operating periods and modes of instruments in order to optimize the scientific return, e.g. targeting magnetospheric boundaries by using the instruments in a low power survey mode to refine predictions of crossing times.\n\nOrbit evolution\n\nAt launch the apogee of the UKS orbit was at a local time of 14:30 hours. As the mission progressed, the UKS apogee precessed to earlier local times at a rate of about 2 hours per month reaching a local time of 05:00 hours when the spacecraft ceased operation on 15 January 1985. Thus UKS gave good coverage of the dayside magnetopause, magnetosheath and bow shock from the early afternoon sector through midday to the dawn sector. These dayside orbits also yielded a large amount of solar wind data. No data are available from the downstream magnetopause or the tail because the spacecraft died before precession allowed it to sample those regions.\n\nNote that the UKS mission took place during the declining phase of solar cycle 21. This was characterised by corotating high-speed streams in the solar wind. These were well observed by UKS in the early months of its mission."

        "Description": "The Magsat project was a joint NASA/United States Geological Survey (USGS) effort to measure near-earth magnetic fields on a global basis. Objectives included obtaining an accurate description of the earth's magnetic field, obtaining data for use in the update and refinement of world and regional magnetic charts, compilation of a global crustal magnetic anomaly map, and interpretation of that map in terms of geologic/geophysical models of the earth's crust. The spacecraft was launched into a low, near-polar, orbit by the Scout vehicle. The basic spacecraft was made up of two distinct parts: the instrument module that contained a vector and a scalar magnetometer and their unique supporting gear; and the base module that contained the necessary data-handling, power, communications, command, and attitude-control subsystems to support the instrument module. The base module complete with its subsystems was comprised of residual Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-C) hardware. The magnetometers were deployed after launch to a position 6 m behind the spacecraft. At this distance, the influence of magnetic materials from the instrument and base module (chiefly from the star cameras) was less than 1 nT. Sixteen complete vector magnetic field measurements and eight scalar measurements were obtained every second."

The satellite was a stainless steel, vacuum-sealed sphere, 0.889 m in diameter. The experimental payload included one ion and two neutral mass spectrometers, three magnetron density gauges, and two electrostatic probes. Additional equipment included optical and magnetic aspect sensors, magnetic attitude and spin rate control systems, and a tape recorder for data acquisition at locations remote from ground receiving stations. Power was supplied by silver-zinc batteries and a solar cell array mounted on the satellite exterior. Two identical pulse-modulated telemetry systems and a canted turnstile antenna were employed. The two neutral-particle mass spectrometers failed about 6 days after launch. The remaining experiments operated satisfactorily and provided useful data for most of the 10-month satellite lifetime. The spacecraft ceased to function due to battery failures which resulted from depressurization of the sphere."

        "Description": "This spacecraft mission combined a Venus swingby and a Comet Halley flyby. Two identical spacecraft, Vega 1 and Vega 2, were launched December 15 and 21, 1984, respectively. After carrying Venus entry probes to the vicinity of Venus (arrival and deployment of probes were scheduled for June 11-15, 1985), the two spacecraft were retargetted using Venus gravity field assistance to intercept Comet Halley in March 1986. The first spacecraft encountered Comet Halley on March 6, 1986, and the second three days later. The flyby velocity was 77.7 km/s. Although the spacecraft could be targetted with a precision of 100 km, the position of the spacecraft relative to the comet nucleus was estimated to be known only to within a few thousand kilometers. This, together with the problem of dust protection, led to estimated flyby distances of 10,000 km for the first spacecraft and 3000 km for the second.\n\nThe spacecraft was three-axis stabilized. Its main features were large solar panels, a high-gain antenna dish, and an automatic pointing platform carrying those experiments that required pointing at the comet nucleus. The automatic platform could rotate through + or -110 deg and + or -40 deg in two perpendicular directions with a pointing accuracy of 5 arc-min and a stability of 1 arc-min/s. It carried the narrow- and the wide-angle camera, the three-channel spectrometer, and the infrared sounder. All other experiments were body-mounted, with the exception of two magnetometer sensors mounted on a 2-m boom and various plasma probes and plasma wavw analyzers mounted on a 5-m boom. The total scientificpayload weighed 125 kg and had a data rate of 65 kbs in fast telemetry mode for encounter. There was also a slow telemetry mode for the cruise mode. The comet-encounter science data-take was from 2.5 h before until 0.5 h after the closest approach, with several periods of data-take before and after, each lasting about 2 h. Continuous coverage for plasma and dust instruments was provided by an onboard memory (5-megabit tape recorder). The spacecraft was shielded from hypervelocity dust impacts by a shield consisting of a 100-micrometer multilayer sheet 20 to 30 cm from the spacecraft, and a 1-mm Al sheet 5 to 10 cm from the spacecraft. Approximately half of the VEGA spacecraft was devoted to the Halley module, and half to the Venus lander package. The total scientific payload weight was 144.3 kg.\n\nThe Venus package consisted of a sphere 240 cm in diameter, which separated two days before arrival at Venus and entered the planet's atmosphere on an inclined path, without active maneuvers, as was done on previous Venera missions. The lander probe was identical to those of Venera 9 through 14 and similarly had two objectives, the study of the atmosphere and the study of the superficial crust. In addition to temperature and pressure measuring instruments, the descent probe carried a UV spectrometer for measurement of minor atmospheric constituents, an instrument dedicated to measurement of the concentration of H2O, and other instruments for determination of the chemical composition of the condensed phase: a gas-phase chromatograph; an X-ray spectrometer observing the fluorescence of grains or drops; and a mass spectrograph measuring the chemical composition of the grains or drops. The X-ray spectrometer separated the grains according to their sizes using a laser imaging device, while the mass spectrograph separated them according to their sizes using an aerodynamical inertial separator. After landing, a small surface sample near the probe was to be analyzed by gamma spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. The UV spectrometer, the mass spectrograph, and the pressure- and temperature-measuring instruments were developed in cooperation between French and Soviet investigators.\n\nIn addition to the lander probe, a constant-pressure instrumented balloon aerostat was deployed after entry into the atmosphere from the upper heat protection hemisphere. It floated at approximately 50 km altitude in the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system. Data from the balloon instruments were transmitted directly to Earth for the 47-hr lifetime of the mission."

The data (including both science data and spacecraft ephemeris/attitude information) from the two NASA-funded science instruments are publicly available to the scientific research community.\n\nTWINS is a stereo mission whose overall scientific objective is to establish the global connectivities and causal relationships between processes in different regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. To meet this goal, TWINS-1 and TWINS-2 provide stereoscopic neutral atom imaging of the magnetosphere from two widely spaced, high-altitude, high-inclination spacecraft.\n\nEach spacecraft carrying TWINS instruments is in a Molniya orbit (63.4 deg, 7.2 Re apogee, 1000 km perigee; period 12 h), and is three-axis stabilized and approximately nadir-pointing. Each acquires image data with time resolution of 60 s. The time required to change actuator direction between scans (no data collection) was 25 seconds from June 2008 to July 2009, and 12 seconds at all other times. This gives an effective cadence of 72 or 85 seconds. The nominal design lifetime for each instrument is four years. TWINS operates only during the apogee portion of each orbit, when the spacecraft is above the radiation belts."

        "Description": "OGO 6 was a large observatory instrumented with 26 experiments designed to study the various interrelationships between, and latitudinal distributions of, high-altitude atmospheric parameters during a period of increased solar activity. The main body of the spacecraft was attitude controlled by means of horizon scanners and gas jets so that its orientation was maintained constant with respect to the earth and the sun. The solar panels rotated on a horizontal axis extending transversely through the main body of the spacecraft. The rotation of the panels was activated by sun sensors so that the panels received maximum sunlight. Seven experiments were mounted on the solar panels (the SOEP package). An additional axis, oriented vertically across the front of the main body, carried seven experiments (the OPEP package). Nominally, these sensors observed in a forward direction in the orbital plane of the satellite. The sensors could be rotated more than 90 deg relative to the nominal observing position and more than 90 deg between the upper and lower OPEP groups mounted on either end of this axis. On June 22, 1969, the spacecraft potential dropped significantly during sunlight operation and remained so during subsequent sunlight operation. This unexplained shift affected seven experiments which made measurements dependent upon knowledge of the spacecraft plasma sheath. During October 1969, a string of solar cells failed, but the only effect of the decreased power was to cause two experiments to change their mode of operation. Also during October 1969, a combination of manual and automatic attitude control was initiated, which extended the control gas lifetime of the attitude control system. In August 1970, tape recorder (TR) no. 1 operation degraded, so all recorded data were subsequently taken with TR no. 2. By September 1970, power and equipment degradation left 14 experiments operating normally, 3 partially, and 9 off. From October 14, 1970, TR no. 2 was used only on Wednesdays (world days) to conserve power and extend TR operation. In June 1971, the number of \"on\" experiments decreased from 13 to 7, and on June 28, 1971, the spacecraft was placed in a spin-stabilized mode about the yaw (Z) axis and turned off due to difficulties with spacecraft power. OGO 6 was turned on again from October 10, 1971, through March 1972, for operation of experiment 25 by The Radio Research Laboratory, Japan. For additional information see J. E. Jackson and J. I. Vette, OGO Program Summary, NASA SP-7601, Dec. 1975."

        "Description": "Explorer 45 was designed to perform a wide variety of investigations within the magnetosphere with regards to particle fluxes, electric fields, and magnetic fields. Its primary scientific objectives were to: (1) study the characteristics and origin of the Earth's ring current and development of the main-phase magnetic storms; and, (2) study the relation between magnetic storms, substorms, and the acceleration of charged particles within the inner magnetosphere. To determine the major wave-particle interaction mechanisms, directional measurements of protons, electrons, and alpha particles were made over a wide energy range, and dc and ac electric and magnetic fields were measured. Explorer 45 had the capability for complete in-flight control of the data format through the use of an onboard set of stored program instructions. These instructions governed the collection of data and were reprogrammable via ground command. The command system handled 80 commands for controlling the spacecraft and experiment functions, as well as for flight program loads for the data processing system. The antenna system consisted of four dipole antennas spaced 90 deg apart on the surface of the spacecraft cover. The satellite contained two transmitters, one for digital (PCM) data at 446 bps, and the other for either the digital data or wideband analog data from 30 Hz to 10 kHz from the ac electric field probes and from one search coil sensor. The satellite power system consisted of a rechargeable battery and an array of solar cells. The spin rate was about 7 rpm, and the spin axis lay in the spacecraft orbital plane which was approximately the same as the earth's equatorial plane. The initial local time of apogee was about 21.8 h and the line of apsides moved around toward the sun at an initial rate of 12 deg per month. The satellite was operationally turned off on September 30, 1974, after approximately three years of successful and productive operation. A coordinated series of papers describing the satellite and the experiments was contained in J. Geophys. Res., v. 78, n. 22, August 1973."

        "Description": "This spacecraft mission combined a Venus swingby and a Comet Halley flyby. Two identical spacecraft, Vega 1 and Vega 2, were launched December 15 and 21, 1984, respectively. After carrying Venus entry probes to the vicinity of Venus (arrival and deployment of probes were scheduled for June 11-15, 1985), the two spacecraft were retargetted using Venus gravity field assistance to intercept Comet Halley in March 1986. The first spacecraft encountered Comet Halley on March 6, 1986, and the second three days later. The flyby velocity was 77.7 km/s. Although the spacecraft could be targetted with a precision of 100 km, the position of the spacecraft relative to the comet nucleus was estimated to be known only to within a few thousand kilometers. This, together with the problem of dust protection, led to estimated flyby distances of 10,000 km for the first spacecraft and 3000 km for the second.\n\nThe spacecraft was three-axis stabilized. Its main features were large solar panels, a high-gain antenna dish, and an automatic pointing platform carrying those experiments that required pointing at the comet nucleus. The automatic platform could rotate through + or -110 deg and + or -40 deg in two perpendicular directions with a pointing accuracy of 5 arc-min and a stability of 1 arc-min/s. It carried the narrow- and the wide-angle camera, the three-channel spectrometer, and the infrared sounder. All other experiments were body-mounted, with the exception of two magnetometer sensors mounted on a 2-m boom and various plasma probes and plasma wavw analyzers mounted on a 5-m boom. The total scientificpayload weighed 125 kg and had a data rate of 65 kbs in fast telemetry mode for encounter. There was also a slow telemetry mode for the cruise mode. The comet-encounter science data-take was from 2.5 h before until 0.5 h after the closest approach, with several periods of data-take before and after, each lasting about 2 h. Continuous coverage for plasma and dust instruments was provided by an onboard memory (5-megabit tape recorder). The spacecraft was shielded from hypervelocity dust impacts by a shield consisting of a 100-micrometer multilayer sheet 20 to 30 cm from the spacecraft, and a 1-mm Al sheet 5 to 10 cm from the spacecraft. Approximately half of the VEGA spacecraft was devoted to the Halley module, and half to the Venus lander package. The total scientific payload weight was 144.3 kg.\n\nThe Venus package consisted of a sphere 240 cm in diameter, which separated two days before arrival at Venus and entered the planet's atmosphere on an inclined path, without active maneuvers, as was done on previous Venera missions. The lander probe was identical to those of Venera 9 through 14 and similarly had two objectives, the study of the atmosphere and the study of the superficial crust. In addition to temperature and pressure measuring instruments, the descent probe carried a UV spectrometer for measurement of minor atmospheric constituents, an instrument dedicated to measurement of the concentration of H2O, and other instruments for determination of the chemical composition of the condensed phase: a gas-phase chromatograph; an X-ray spectrometer observing the fluorescence of grains or drops; and a mass spectrograph measuring the chemical composition of the grains or drops. The X-ray spectrometer separated the grains according to their sizes using a laser imaging device, while the mass spectrograph separated them according to their sizes using an aerodynamical inertial separator. After landing, a small surface sample near the probe was to be analyzed by gamma spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. The UV spectrometer, the mass spectrograph, and the pressure- and temperature-measuring instruments were developed in cooperation between French and Soviet investigators.\n\nIn addition to the lander probe, a constant-pressure instrumented balloon aerostat was deployed after entry into the atmosphere from the upper heat protection hemisphere. It floated at approximately 50 km altitude in the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system. Data from the balloon instruments were transmitted directly to Earth for the 47-hr lifetime of the mission."

        "Description": "OGO 2 was a large observatory instrumented with 20 experiments designed to make simultaneous, correlative observations of aurora and airglow emissions, energetic particles, magnetic field variations, ionospheric properties, etc., especially over the polar areas.\n\n\nOGO 2 consisted of a main body, generally parallelepipedal in form, two rectangular solar panels, each with a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), and two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP). It also included six experiment packages (EP-1,-2,-3,-4,-5, and -6) mounted on booms extending generally fore and aft of the spacecraft along the Y axis. Antenna and attitude control fixtures also extended from separate and/or EP booms. The main body was attitude-controlled by use of horizon scanners and gas jets and was designed to point toward the earth (Z axis). The axis connecting the two solar panels (X axis) was designed to oscillate in order to remain perpendicular to the earth-sun-spacecraft plane. The solar panels activated by sun sensors could rotate about this X axis in order to obtain maximum radiation for the solar cells and concurrently orient the SOEP properly. The OPEPs were reoriented on either end of an axis that was parallel to the Z axis and attached to the forward end of the main body. These OPEP sensors normally were maintained looking forward in the orbital plane of the satellite. To maintain this orientation, the OPEP axis could rotate over 90 degrees. In addition, an angular difference of over 90 degrees was possible between the orientation of the upper and lower OPEP packages. The SOEP contained four experiments, and the OPEP contained five experiments.\n\n\nSoon after achieving orbit, difficulties in maintaining earth lock with horizon scanners caused exhaustion of attitude control gas by October 23, 1965, 10 days after launch. At this time, the spacecraft entered a spin mode (about 0.11 rpm) with a large coning angle about the previously vertical axis. Five experiments became useless when the satellite went into this spin mode. Six additional experiments were degraded by this loss of attitude control. By April 1966, both batteries had failed, so subsequent observations were limited to sunlit portions of the orbit. By December 1966, only eight experiments were operational, five of which were not degraded by the spin mode operation. By April 1967, the tape recorders had malfunctioned and only one third of the recorded data could be processed. Spacecraft power and periods of operational scheduling conflicts created six large data gaps so that data were observed on a total of about 306 days of the 2-yr, 18-day total span of observed satellite data to November 1, 1967. The data gaps were (a) October 24, 1965, to November 5, 1965, (b) December 6, 1965, to January 7, 1966, (c) April 9, 1966, to June 21, 1966, (d) September 2, 1966, to November 18, 1966, (e) December 27, 1966, to April 11, 1967, and (f) May 9, 1967, to September 19, 1967. The spacecraft was shut down on November 1, 1967, with eight experiments still operational. It was reactivated for 2 weeks in February 1968 to operate experiment 65-081A-05.

        "Description": "Voyager 2 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nEach Voyager consisted of a decahedral bus, 47 cm in height and 1.78 m across from flat to flat. A 3.66 m diameter parabolic high-gain antenna was mounted on top of the bus. The major portion of the science instruments were mounted on a science boom extending out some 2.5 m from the spacecraft. At the end of the science boom was a steerable scan platform on which were mounted the imaging and spectroscopic remote sensing instruments. Also mounted at various distances along the science boom were the plasma and charged particle detectors. The magnetometers were located along a separate boom extending 13 m on the side opposite the science boom. A third boom, extending down and away from the science instruments, held the spacecraft's radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Two 10 m whip antennas (used for the plasma wave and planetary radio astronomy investigations) also extended from the spacecraft, each perpendicular to the other. The spacecraft was three-axis spin stabilized to enable long integration times and selective viewing for the instruments mounted on the scan platform.\n\nPower was provided to the spacecraft systems and instruments through the use of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The RTGs were assembled in tandem on a deployable boom hinged on an outrigger arrangement of struts attached to the basic structure. Each RTG unit, contained in a beryllium outer case, was 40.6 cm in diameter, 50.8 cm in length, and weighed 39 kg. The RTGs used a radioactive source (Plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium oxide, or PuO2, in this case) which, as it decayed, gave off heat. A bi-metallic thermoelectric device was used to convert the heat to electric power for the spacecraft. The total output of RTGs slowly decreases with time as the radioactive material is expended. Therefore, although the initial output of the RTGs on Voyager was approximately 470 W of 30 V DC power at launch, it had fallen off to approximately 335 W by the beginning of 1997 (about 19.5 years post-launch). As power continues to decrease, power loads on the spacecraft must also decrease. Current estimates (1998) are that increasingly limited instrument operations can be carried out at least until 2020.\n\nCommunications were provided through the high-gain antenna with a low-gain antenna for backup. The high-gain antenna supported both X-band and S-band downlink telemetry. Voyager was the first spacecraft to utilize X-band as the primary telemetry link frequency. Data could be stored for later transmission to Earth through the use of an on-board digital tape recorder.\n\nVoyager, because of its distance from Earth and the resulting time-lag for commanding, was designed to operate in a highly-autonomous manner. In order to do this and carry out the complex sequences of spacecraft motions and instrument operations, three interconnected on-board computers were utilized. The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) was responsible for storing commanding for the other two computers and issuing the commands at set times. The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) was responsible for controlling spacecraft attitude and motions of the scan platform. The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) controlled the instruments, including changes in configuration (state) or telemetry rates. All three computers had redundant components to ensure continued operations. The AACS included redundant star trackers and Sun sensors as well.\n\nMessage in a Bottle\n\nEach Voyager has mounted to one of the sides of the bus a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk. The disk has recorded on it sounds and images of Earth designed to portray the diversity of life and culture on the planet. Each disk is encased in a protective aluminum jacket along with a cartridge and a needle. Instructions explaining from where the spacecraft originated and how to play the disk are engraved onto the jacket. Electroplated onto a 2 cm area on the cover is also an ultra-pure source of uranium-238 (with a radioactivity of about 0.26 nanocuries and a half-life of 4.51 billion years), allowing the determination of the elapsed time since launch by measuring the amount of daughter elements to remaining U238. The 115 images on the disk were encoded in analog form. The sound selections (including greetings in 55 languages, 35 sounds, natural and man-made, and portions of 27 musical pieces) are designed for playback at 1000 rpm. The Voyagers were not the first spacecraft designed with such messages to the future. Pioneers 10 and 11, LAGEOS, and the Apollo landers also included plaques with a similar intent, though not quite so ambitious.\n\nMission Profile\n\nOriginally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.\n\nVoyager 2 was the first of the two spacecraft to be launched, with liftoff occurring 20 Aug. 1977. What was at first an auspicious launch, however, proved to be the beginning of a number of problems. The primary cause of the initial problems were attributed to commanding by the AACS, including difficulty in determining the full deployment of the science boom. These problems resulted in a delay of four days in the launch of Voyager 1 to ensure they wouldn't occur for it.\n\nAlthough launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun.\n\nSeveral months after launch, in April 1978, Voyager 2's primary radio receiver failed, automatically kicking in the backup receiver which proved to be faulty. Attempts to recover the use of the primary receiver failed and the backup receiver was used for the remainder of the mission. Although use of the backup receiver made communication with the spacecraft more difficult, engineers were able to find workarounds.\n\nVoyager 2 proceeded with its primary mission and flew by Jupiter (closest approach on 09 July 1979) and Saturn (05 Aug. 1981). During these flybys, Voyager 2 obtained images roughly equal in number to Voyager 1 (18,000 at Jupiter, 16,000 at Saturn).\n\nVoyager 2's launch date had preserved one part of the original Grand Tour design, i.e. the possibility of an extended mission to Uranus and Neptune. Despite the difficulties encountered, scientists and engineers had been able to make Voyager enormously successful. As a result, approval was granted to extend the mission, first to Uranus, then to Neptune and later to continue observations well past Neptune. Voyager 2 made successful flybys of Uranus (24 Jan. 1986) and Neptune (25 Aug. 1989). Because of the additional distance of these two planets, adaptations had to made to accomodate the lower light levels and decreased communications. Voyager 2 was successfully able to obtain about 8,000 images of Uranus and its satellites. Additional improvements in the on-board software and use of image compression techniques allowed about 10,000 images of Neptune and its satellites to be taken.\n\nAll of the experiments on Voyager 2 have produced useful data.\n\nOnward and Outward\n\nRechristened the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) by NASA in 1989 after its encounter with Neptune, Voyager 2 continues operations, taking measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field, plasma, and charged particle environment while searching for the heliopause (the distance at which the solar wind becomes subsumed by the more general interstellar wind). Through the end of the Neptune phase of the Voyager project, a total of $875 million had been expended for the construction, launch, and operations of both Voyager spacecraft. An additional $30 million was allocated for the first two years of VIM.\n\nVoyager 2 is speeding away from the Sun at a velocity of about 3.13 AU/year toward a point in the sky of RA=338 degrees, Dec=-62 degrees (-47.46 degrees ecliptic latitude, 310.89 degrees ecliptic longitude)."

The payload consisted of a fluxgate magnetometer; electric and magnetic wave experiments, which covered various bands in the frequency range 6 Hz to 3 MHz; charged particle experiments, which covered various energy ranges starting with solar wind thermal energies and extending to 1 GeV; a zodiacal light experiment; and a micrometeoroid experiment. The purpose of the mission was to make pioneering measurements of the interplanetary medium from the vicinity of the earth's orbit to 0.3 AU. The spacecraft was spin stabilized with the spin axis normal to the ecliptic, and a nominal spin rate of 1 rps. The outer surface was coated with a conductive material, resulting in a plasma-sheath potential of typically 5 eV. Sheath-related coupling caused by the spacecraft antennae produced interference with the wave experiments, but the character of the interference was different from that observed on the Helios-A spacecraft. The spacecraft was capable of being operated at bit rates of from 4096 to 8 bps, variable by factors of two. While the spacecraft was moving to perihelion, it was generally operated from 64 to 256 bps; near 0.3 AU, it was operated at higher bit rates. Because of difficulty encountered with the high-gain antenna, and scheduling conflicts with Viking, relatively fewer high-bit-rate data were obtained from Helios-B than were available from Helios-A. Instrument descriptions written by the experiments are published (some in German, some in English) in the journal Raumfahrtforschung, v. 19, n. 5, 1975."

        "Description": "This Cluster II spacecraft, FM8 (Tango), was launched together with FM5 (Rumba) by\n   a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Baikonur. The four similar spacecraft of the Cluster II mission are\n   part of ESA's and NASA's Solar-Terrestrial Science Program (STSP). The current Cluster II mission\n   is a near-replica of the original four-spacecraft mission lost at launch in 1996. (NSSDC will\n   carry the name \"Cluster96\" in its information files to designate the unsuccessful 1996 four-spacecraft\n   Ariane 5 launch.) The purpose of the Cluster II mission is to study small-scale structures in\n   three dimensions in the Earth's plasma environment, such as those involved in the interaction between\n   the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma, in global magnetotail dynamics, in cross-tail\n   currents, and in the formation and dynamics of the neutral line and of plasmoids.\n\nThe four Cluster II spacecraft will orbit in a tetrahedral formation in near-polar orbits of nominally\n4 x 19.6 Earth radii, with period about 57 hours, and inclination about 90.7 degrees. Relative distances\nbetween the spacecraft will be adjusted in the course of the mission, depending on the spatial scales of\nthe structures to be studied, varying from a few hundred km to a few Earth radii. The tetrahedral\nformation is essential for making three-dimensional measurements and for determining the curl of vectorial\nquantities such as the magnetic field.\n\nThe orbits of all four spacecraft will be frequently maneuvered so as to achieve the targeted investigations.\n\nEach spacecraft will be spin-stabilized, normally at around 15 rpm, and will be cylindrical in shape, with\na 2.9-m diameter and 1.3-m length. It will have two rigid 5-m radial experiment booms, four 50-m experiment\nwire booms, and two axial telecommunications antenna booms. Telemetry downlink bit rate will be 2 to 262 kbit/s.\n\nEach spacecraft will have AC and DC magnetometers, an electric fields and waves sensor, an electron\nemitter/detector, an electron density sounder, electron and ion plasma analysers, an energetic particle\ndetector, an ion emitter, and a data processing unit.\n\nCluster operations will be performed by ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany, with support from NASA's Deep Space\nNetwork. Cluster is also an IACG mission. The scientific data are distributed by ESOC using CD-ROM as a\nmedium to the Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators and the network of eight national data centres\n(6 in Europe, 1 in USA and 1 in China) that form the Cluster Science Data System (CSDS). There are\napproximately 80 recipients world-wide. Science operations are carried out by the Joint Science\nOperations Centre, co-located with the UK data centre at RAL, Didcot. A wide scientific community will\nhave differing rights of access to the Cluster data.

Its objective was to obtain worldwide observations of total electron content between the spacecraft and the earth. The satellite was initially spin-stabilized, but it was despun after solar paddle erection. Subsequent stabilization oriented the satellite axis of symmetry with the local magnetic field by means of a strong bar magnet and damping rods. A three-axis magnetometer and sun sensors provided information on the satellite attitude and spin rate. There was no tape recorder aboard so that satellite performance data and electrostatic probe data could be observed only when the satellite was within range of a ground telemetry station. Continuous transmitters also operated at 162 and 324 MHz to permit precise tracking by \"Transit\" tracking stations for navigation and geodetic studies. In August 1968, data acquisition from the satellite telemetry channels was discontinued. In July 1969, tracking and world map production were discontinued by GSFC, and world map production based on NORAD orbit elements was subsequently assumed by ESRO. The satellite failed in February 1970 and BE-C (65-032A) was turned on in order to partially replace use made of this satellite beacon experiment."

        "Description": "The Apollo 15 lunar module (LM) \"Falcon\" was the fourth crewed vehicle to land on the Moon. It carried two astronauts,\n        Commander David R. Scott and LM pilot James B. Irwin, the seventh and eighth men to walk on the Moon. The LM also carried a Lunar Roving\n        Vehicle (LRV), an Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) that contained scientific experiments to be deployed and left on the\n        lunar surface, and other scientific and sample collection apparatus. The experiments performed on the Moon, in addition to the ALSEP suite,\n        were geologic sample collection, surface photography, soil mechanics investigations to study physical properties of the lunar regolith, and\n        the solar wind composition experiment which collected samples of solar wind particles for return to Earth.\n\n        Mission Profile\n\n        The LM separated from the Command/Service Module (CSM) at 18:13:30 UT and landed at 22:16:29 UT (6:16:29 p.m. EDT) on 30 July 1971 in the\n        Mare Imbrium region at the foot of the Apennine mountain range at 26.1322 N latitude, 3.6339 E longitude (IAU Mean Earth Polar Axis\n        coordinate system). Scott and Irwin made three moonwalk extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) totaling 18 hours, 35 minutes. During this time\n        they covered 27.9 km and collected 77.31 kg of rock and soil samples. The LRV was used to explore regions within 5 km of the LM landing site.\n        This was the first time a vehicle of this type had been used, and its performance on the lunar terrain was very successful. Two hours after\n        landing the cabin was depressurized and Scott performed a standup EVA for 33 minutes, describing and photographing the surrounding terrain\n        from the LM upper hatch. The first moonwalk EVA was on 31 July from 13:13:10 UT to 19:45:59 UT, during which time the LRV was unloaded,\n        deployed, and driven. Photographs of the lunar surface were taken and geologic samples were collected from the LM site and during the three\n        geological traverses. The traverse on the first EVA covered 10.3 km to the edge of Hadley Rille to Elbow Crater and near St. George Crater\n        and back to the LM, where a core sample was taken from three meters below the surface. The ALSEP was deployed at the end of the traverse. On\n        the second EVA, on 1 August from 11:48:48 UT to 19:01:02 UT, the LRV was driven on a 12.5 km traverse southeast along the base of the\n        Appenine Mountains near Index, Arbeit, Crescent, Dune, and Spur craters and back to the ALSEP site. On the third EVA on 2 August from\n        08:52:14 UT to 13:42:04 UT the LRV was driven a total of 5.1 km west to Scarp Crater and northwest along the edge of Hadley Rille and back\n        east across the mare. After the final EVA Scott performed a televised demonstration of a hammer and feather falling at the same rate in the\n        lunar vacuum. The astronauts also left a plaque and small figure on the surface in memory of all fourteen American and Soviet space explorers\n        who had died during the two nation's space programs. The LM lifted off the Moon on 2 August at 17:11:22 UT after 66 hours, 55 minutes on the\n        lunar surface. After docking with the CSM (piloted by Alfred M. Worden) at 19:09:47 UT the LM was jettisoned on 3 August at 01:04:14 UT and\n        impacted on the Moon 2 hours later (03:03:37.0 UT) at 26.36 N, 0.25 E.\n\n        Lunar Module Spacecraft and Subsystems\n\n        The lunar module was a two-stage vehicle designed for space operations near and on the Moon. The spacecraft mass of 16,434 kg was the mass of\n        the LM including astronauts, expendables, and approximately 12,000 kg of propellants. The fully fueled mass of the ascent stage was about\n        4971 kg and the descent stage 11,463 kg. The ascent and descent stages of the LM operated as a unit until staging, when the ascent stage\n        functioned as a single spacecraft for rendezvous and docking with the command and service module (CSM). The descent stage comprised the lower\n        part of the spacecraft and was an octagonal prism 4.2 meters across and 1.7 m thick. Four landing legs with round footpads were mounted on\n        the sides of the descent stage and held the bottom of the stage 1.5 m above the surface. The distance between the ends of the footpads on\n        opposite landing legs was 9.4 m. One of the legs had a small astronaut egress platform and ladder. A one meter long conical descent engine\n        skirt protruded from the bottom of the stage. The descent stage contained the landing rocket, two tanks of aerozine 50 fuel, two tanks of\n        nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer, water, oxygen and helium tanks and storage space for the lunar equipment and experiments, and in the case of\n        Apollo 15, 16, and 17, the lunar rover. The descent stage served as a platform for launching the ascent stage and was left behind on the Moon.\n\n        The ascent stage was an irregularly shaped unit approximately 2.8 m high and 4.0 by 4.3 meters in width mounted on top of the descent stage.\n        The ascent stage housed the astronauts in a pressurized crew compartment with a volume of 6.65 cubic meters. There was an ingress-egress\n        hatch in one side and a docking hatch for connecting to the CSM on top. Also mounted along the top were a parabolic rendezvous radar antenna,\n        a steerable parabolic S-band antenna, and 2 in-flight VHF antennas. Two triangular windows were above and to either side of the egress hatch\n        and four thrust chamber assemblies were mounted around the sides. At the base of the assembly was the ascent engine. The stage also contained\n        an aerozine 50 fuel and an oxidizer tank, and helium, liquid oxygen, gaseous oxygen, and reaction control fuel tanks. There were no seats in\n        the LM. A control console was mounted in the front of the crew compartment above the ingress-egress hatch and between the windows and two\n        more control panels mounted on the side walls. The ascent stage was launched from the Moon at the end of lunar surface operations and\n        returned the astronauts to the CSM.\n\n        The descent engine was a deep-throttling ablative rocket with a maximum thrust of about 45,000 N mounted on a gimbal ring in the center of\n        the descent stage. The ascent engine was a fixed, constant-thrust rocket with a thrust of about 15,000 N. Maneuvering was achieved via the\n        reaction control system, which consisted of the four thrust modules, each one composed of four 450 N thrust chambers and nozzles pointing in\n        different directions. Telemetry, TV, voice, and range communications with Earth were all via the S-band antenna. VHF was used for\n        communications between the astronauts and the LM, and the LM and orbiting CSM. There were redundant tranceivers and equipment for both\n        S-band and VHF. An environmental control system recycled oxygen and maintained temperature in the electronics and cabin. Power was provided\n        by 6 silver-zinc batteries. Guidance and navigation control were provided by a radar ranging system, an inertial measurement unit consisting\n        of gyroscopes and accelerometers, and the Apollo guidance computer.\n\n        Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP)\n\n        The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) consisted of a set of scientific instruments emplaced at the landing site by the\n        astronauts. The instruments were arrayed around a central station which supplied power to run the instruments and communications so data\n        collected by the experiments could be relayed to Earth. The central station was a 25 kg box with a stowed volume of 34,800 cubic cm. Thermal\n        control was achieved by passive elements (insulation, reflectors, thermal coatings) as well as power dissipation resistors and heaters.\n        Communications with Earth were achieved through a 58 cm long, 3.8 cm diameter modified axial-helical antenna mounted on top of the central\n        station and pointed towards Earth by the astronauts. Transmitters, receivers, data processors and multiplexers were housed within the\n        central station. Data collected from the instruments were converted into a telemetry format and transmitted to Earth. The ALSEP system and\n        instruments were controlled by commands from Earth. The uplink frequency for all Apollo mission ALSEP's was 2119 MHz, the downlink frequency\n        for the Apollo 15 ALSEP was 2278.0 MHz.\n\n        Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG)\n\n        The SNAP-27 model RTG produced the power to run the ALSEP operations. The generator consisted of a 46 cm high central cylinder and eight\n        radiating rectangular fins with a total tip-to-tip diameter of 40 cm. The central cylinder had a thinner concentric inner cylinder inside,\n        and the two cylinders were attached along their surfaces by 442 spring-loaded lead-telluride thermoelectric couples mounted radially along\n        the length of the cylinders. The generator assembly had a total mass of 17 kg. The power source was an approximately 4 kg fuel capsule in\n        the shape of a long rod which contained plutonium-238 and was placed in the inner cylinder of the RTG by the astronauts on deployment.\n        Plutonium-238 decays with a half-life of 89.6 years and produces heat. This heat would conduct from the inner cylinder to the outer via the\n        thermocouples which would convert the heat directly to electrical power. Excess heat on the outer cylinder would be radiated to space by the\n        fins. The RTG produced approximately 70 W DC at 16 V. (63.5 W after one year.) The electricity was routed through a cable to a power\n        conditioning unit and a power distribution unit in the central station to supply the correct voltage and power to each instrument.\n\n        ALSEP Scientific Instruments\n\n        All ALSEP instruments were deployed on the surface by the astronauts and attached to the central station by cables. The Apollo 15 ALSEP\n        instruments consisted of: (1) a passive seismometer, designed to measure seismic activity and physical properties of the lunar crust and\n        interior; (2) a lunar surface magnetometer (LSM), designed to measure the magnetic field at the lunar surface; (3) a solar wind\n        spectrometer, which measured the fluxes and spectra of the electrons and protons that emanate from the Sun and reach the lunar surface;\n        (4) a suprathermal ion detector, designed to measure the flux, composition, energy, and velocity of low-energy positive ions; (5) a cold\n        cathode ion gauge, designed to measure the atmosphere and any variations with time or solar activity such atmosphere may have; (6) a lunar\n        dust detector, to measure dust accumulation, radiation damage to solar cells, and reflected infrared energy and temperatures; and (7) a\n        heat flow experiment, designed to measure the rate of heat loss from the lunar interior and the thermal properties of lunar material. The\n        central station, located at 26.1341 N latitude, 3.6298 E longitude, was turned on at 18:37 UT on 31 July 1971 and shut down along with the\n        other ALSEP stations on 30 September 1977.     \n"

        "Description": "The primary scientific aims of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory mission (SOHO) were to investigate: (1) the physical processes that form and heat the Sun's corona, maintain it and give rise to the expanding solar wind; and, (2) the interior structure of the Sun. Imaging and collection of spectroscopic plasma diagnostics of the solar chromosphere, transition region and corona, as well as in situ solar-wind measurements are used to study the corona and solar wind. Solar interior structure is investigated by helioseismological means and by the observation of variations in solar irradiance. SOHO was part of the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics Program (ISTP).\n\nThe SOHO spacecraft was three-axis stabilized and pointed towards the Sun with an accuracy of +/- 10 arcsec per 15 min. It consisted of a Payload Module to accommodate the instruments and a Service Module carrying the spacecraft subsystems and solar arrays. SOHO occupied a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrangian point to obtain uninterrupted sunlight. The design life was two years, but on-board consumables were sufficient for an extra four years of operations.\n\nTwelve instruments comprised the payload, producing a continuous stream of data at 40 kbs, except whenever the solar oscillations imager Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) was operated in high-bit-rate mode, producing 160 kbs. The high-bit-rate mode was used during scheduled daily eight-hour periods or during dedicated campaigns. Magnetic tape stored data between telemetry contacts with the Experiment Operations Facility, located at NASA-GSFC. For more information, see B. Fleck, V. Domingo, and A. I. Poland, eds., Solar Physics, V. 162, 1995.\n\nSOHO was a joint mission of the European Space Agency and NASA. It was launched aboard an Atlas IIAS rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Station, FL, on Dec. 2, 1995, and mission operations were directed from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.\n\nIn April 1998, SOHO successfully completed its nominal two-year mission to study the Sun's atmosphere, surface and interior. Major science highlights include the detection of rivers of plasma beneath the surface of the Sun; the discovery of a magnetic \"carpet\" on the solar surface that seems to account for a substantial part of the energy that is needed to cause the very high temperature of the corona, the Sun's outermost layer; the first detection of flare-induced solar quakes; the discovery of more than 50 sungrazing comets; the most detailed view to date of the solar atmosphere; and spectacular images and movies of coronal mass ejections, which were being used to improve the ability to forecast space weather.\n\nContact with SOHO was lost at 23:16 GMT on June 24, 1998 during maintenance operations. The spacecraft went into emergency sun reacquisition mode, which is activated when an anomaly occurs and the spacecraft loses its orientation toward the Sun. When this happened, the spacecraft automatically tried to point itself toward the Sun again by firing its attitude control thrusters under the guidance of an onboard Sun sensor. Efforts to re-establish contact with SOHO did not succeed and telemetry was lost, not to be reestablished for several weeks.\n\nAttitude analysis led to the conclusion that SOHO went into a spin such that the solar panels were nearly edge-on towards the Sun, and thus did not generate any power. Because the spin axis is fixed in space, as the spacecraft progressed in its orbit the orientation of the panels with respect to the Sun gradually changed, resulting in increased solar illumination of the solar arrays as time progressed. On August 3, contact was re-established with SOHO following six weeks of silence. After a lengthy recovery process, on September 16 the spacecraft again locked onto the Sun, and experiment heaters were switched on. After recommissioning of various subsystems, and an orbit correction maneuver, SOHO was finally brought back to normal mode on 25 September at 19:52:58 GMT. Instrument switch-on started October 5, 1998, and by November 4 all instruments were back to normal."

Although the spacecraft could be targetted with a precision of 100 km, the position of the spacecraft relative to the comet nucleus was estimated to be known only to within a few thousand kilometers. This, together with the problem of dust protection, led to estimated flyby distances of 10,000 km for the first spacecraft and 3000 km for the second.\n\nThe spacecraft was three-axis stabilized. Its main features were large solar panels, a high-gain antenna dish, and an automatic pointing platform carrying those experiments that required pointing at the comet nucleus. The automatic platform could rotate through + or -110 deg and + or -40 deg in two perpendicular directions with a pointing accuracy of 5 arc-min and a stability of 1 arc-min/s. It carried the narrow- and the wide-angle camera, the three-channel spectrometer, and the infrared sounder. All other experiments were body-mounted, with the exception of two magnetometer sensors mounted on a 2-m boom and various plasma probes and plasma wavw analyzers mounted on a 5-m boom. The total scientificpayload weighed 125 kg and had a data rate of 65 kbs in fast telemetry mode for encounter. There was also a slow telemetry mode for the cruise mode. The comet-encounter science data-take was from 2.5 h before until 0.5 h after the closest approach, with several periods of data-take before and after, each lasting about 2 h. Continuous coverage for plasma and dust instruments was provided by an onboard memory (5-megabit tape recorder). The spacecraft was shielded from hypervelocity dust impacts by a shield consisting of a 100-micrometer multilayer sheet 20 to 30 cm from the spacecraft, and a 1-mm Al sheet 5 to 10 cm from the spacecraft. Approximately half of the VEGA spacecraft was devoted to the Halley module, and half to the Venus lander package. The total scientific payload weight was 144.3 kg.\n\nThe Venus package consisted of a sphere 240 cm in diameter, which separated two days before arrival at Venus and entered the planet's atmosphere on an inclined path, without active maneuvers, as was done on previous Venera missions. The lander probe was identical to those of Venera 9 through 14 and similarly had two objectives, the study of the atmosphere and the study of the superficial crust. In addition to temperature and pressure measuring instruments, the descent probe carried a UV spectrometer for measurement of minor atmospheric constituents, an instrument dedicated to measurement of the concentration of H2O, and other instruments for determination of the chemical composition of the condensed phase: a gas-phase chromatograph; an X-ray spectrometer observing the fluorescence of grains or drops; and a mass spectrograph measuring the chemical composition of the grains or drops. The X-ray spectrometer separated the grains according to their sizes using a laser imaging device, while the mass spectrograph separated them according to their sizes using an aerodynamical inertial separator. After landing, a small surface sample near the probe was to be analyzed by gamma spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. The UV spectrometer, the mass spectrograph, and the pressure- and temperature-measuring instruments were developed in cooperation between French and Soviet investigators.\n\nIn addition to the lander probe, a constant-pressure instrumented balloon aerostat was deployed after entry into the atmosphere from the upper heat protection hemisphere. It floated at approximately 50 km altitude in the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system. Data from the balloon instruments were transmitted directly to Earth for the 47-hr lifetime of the mission."

The scientific objectives of the mission are to characterize the asteroids' internal structure, density, shape, size, composition, and mass and to return data on surface morphology, cratering, and magnetism. These measurements will help determine the thermal history, size of the core, role of water in asteroid evolution, and what meteorites found on Earth come from these bodies with the ultimate goal of understanding the conditions and processes present at the solar system's earliest epoch and the role of water content and size in planetary evolution. The data returned will include for both asteroids:\n\n* 1) Full surface imagery\n* 2) Full surface spectrometric mapping\n* 3) Elemental abundances\n* 4) Topographic profiles\n* 5) Gravity fields\n* 6) Mapping of remnant magnetism, if any\n\n* Spacecraft and Subsystems\n* =========================\n\nThe Dawn spacecraft is generally box-shaped with dimensions equal to 1.64 m \u2a2f 1.27 m \u2a2f 1.77 m. The box structure is made of aluminum and graphite composite with a dry mass of 747.1 kg and a fueled launch mass of 1217.7 kg. The spacecraft core is a graphite composite cylinder with the titanium hydrazine and xenon tanks mounted inside. Mounting, access, and other panels are aluminum core with aluminum facesheets. Two solar panel wings extend 19.7 m tip-to-tip and are mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft. A parabolic fixed 1.52 m high gain dish antenna is mounted on one side of the spacecraft in the same plane as the solar arrays. Three low gain antennas are also mounted on the spacecraft. A 5 m long magnetometer boom extends from the top panel of the spacecraft. Also mounted on the top panel is the instrument bench, which holds the cameras, mapping spectrometer, laser altimeter, and star trackers. A gamma ray/neutron spectrometer is mounted on the top panel as well.\n\nThe two 2.3 \u2a2f 8.3 m solar arrays, which are composed of InGaP/InGaAs/Ge triple-junction cells, provide 10.3 kW at 1 AU and are expected to provide 1.3 kW at end of life at 3 AU to drive the spacecraft (22 V to 35 V) and the solar electric ion propulsion system (80 V to 140 V). Power is stored in a 35 A h Nickel-Hydrogen, NiH2, battery. The ion propulsion consists of three ion thrusters and is based on the Deep Space 1 spacecraft ion drive using xenon which is ionized and accelerated by electrodes. The xenon ion engines have a maximum thrust at 2.6 kW input power of 92 mN and a specific impulse of 3200 s to 1900 s. The 30 cm diameter thrusters are two-axis gimbal mounted at the base of the spacecraft. The xenon tank held 425 kg of propellant at launch.\n\nAttitude control is maintained by reaction wheels and twelve 0.9 N hydrazine engines placed around the spacecraft. The hydrazine tank holds 45.6 kg propellant at launch. The hydrazine thrusters can also be used to help orbit insertion maneuvers. Attitude knowledge is provided by star trackers and gyros. The thermal control system consists of ammonia-based heat pipes and louvers, and requires roughly 200 W at 3 AU. Communications are in X-band for both uplink and downlin, through the body-fixed high gain and medium gain antennas and a low gain omnidirectional antenna, utilizing a 100 W traveling wave tube amplifier, TWTA. The command and data handling system utilizes a radiation-hardened single board computer RAD6000 processor, 8 Gb mass memory, and a Mil-Std-1553B data bus. Uplink data rates range from 7.8 b/s to 2.0 kb/s and downlink rates from 10 b/s to 124 kb/s.\n\n* Mission Profile\n* ===============\n\nLaunch from Cape Canaveral on a Delta 2 (7925-H) took place on September 27, 2007 at 11:34 UT  or equvalently 07:34 am EDT. Transfer into a trajectory towards the asteroid belt took place approximately 1 h later. After a four year heliocentric cruise including a Mars flyby to within 542 km of the surface and gravity assist on February 18, 2009 at 00:27:58 UT. Dawn reached Vesta on July 16, 2011 and used its hydrazine thrusters to go into orbit. Dawn spiraled down to a high survey orbit at 2750 km altitude with a period of 69 h on August 2nd, followed by a 12.3 h mapping orbit at 680 km on September 27th and then a lower 210 km, 4.3 h mapping orbit on December 8th. Dawn departed Vesta on September 5, 2012 at 06:26 UT and entered initial orbit around Ceres on March 6, 2015 at 12:29 UT. It reshaped the orbit to its first science orbit, circular with an altitude of 13500 km, reaching this configuration on April 23rd. It spiraled down into lower orbits, and finally to a 375 km altitude circular science orbit achieving this in December of 2015. The end of the primary mission took place in June 2016. After the end of the mission, Dawn remained in orbit around Ceres, communications ended on October 31, 2018. The final orbit will be stable with a lifetime of several hundred years. The total cost for the mission is estimated to be $446 million."

        "Description": "Voyager 1 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nEach Voyager consisted of a decahedral bus, 47 cm in height and 1.78 m across from flat to flat. A 3.66 m diameter parabolic high-gain antenna was mounted on top of the bus. The major portion of the science instruments were mounted on a science boom extending out some 2.5 m from the spacecraft. At the end of the science boom was a steerable scan platform on which were mounted the imaging and spectroscopic remote sensing instruments. Also mounted at various distances along the science boom were the plasma and charged particle detectors. The magnetometers were located along a separate boom extending 13 m on the side opposite the science boom. A third boom, extending down and away from the science instruments, held the spacecraft's radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Two 10 m whip antennas (used for the plasma wave and planetary radio astronomy investigations) also extended from the spacecraft, each perpendicular to the other. The spacecraft was three-axis spin stabilized to enable long integration times and selective viewing for the instruments mounted on the scan platform.\n\nPower was provided to the spacecraft systems and instruments through the use of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The RTGs were assembled in tandem on a deployable boom hinged on an outrigger arrangement of struts attached to the basic structure. Each RTG unit, contained in a beryllium outer case, was 40.6 cm in diameter, 50.8 cm in length, and weighed 39 kg. The RTGs used a radioactive source (Plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium oxide, or PuO2, in this case) which, as it decayed, gave off heat. A bi-metallic thermoelectric device was used to convert the heat to electric power for the spacecraft. The total output of RTGs slowly decreases with time as the radioactive material is expended. Therefore, although the initial output of the RTGs on Voyager was approximately 470 W of 30 V DC power at launch, it had fallen off to approximately 335 W by the beginning of 1997 (about 19.5 years post-launch). As power continues to decrease, power loads on the spacecraft must also decrease. Current estimates (1998) are that increasingly limited instrument operations can be carried out at least until 2020.\n\nCommunications were provided through the high-gain antenna with a low-gain antenna for backup. The high-gain antenna supported both X-band and S-band downlink telemetry. Voyager was the first spacecraft to utilize X-band as the primary telemetry link frequency. Data could be stored for later transmission to Earth through the use of an on-board digital tape recorder.\n\nVoyager, because of its distance from Earth and the resulting time-lag for commanding, was designed to operate in a highly-autonomous manner. In order to do this and carry out the complex sequences of spacecraft motions and instrument operations, three interconnected on-board computers were utilized. The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) was responsible for storing commanding for the other two computers and issuing the commands at set times. The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) was responsible for controlling spacecraft attitude and motions of the scan platform. The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) controlled the instruments, including changes in configuration (state) or telemetry rates. All three computers had redundant components to ensure continued operations. The AACS included redundant star trackers and Sun sensors as well.\n\nMessage in a Bottle\n\nEach Voyager has mounted to one of the sides of the bus a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk. The disk has recorded on it sounds and images of Earth designed to portray the diversity of life and culture on the planet. Each disk is encased in a protective aluminum jacket along with a cartridge and a needle. Instructions explaining from where the spacecraft originated and how to play the disk are engraved onto the jacket. Electroplated onto a 2 cm area on the cover is also an ultra-pure source of uranium-238 (with a radioactivity of about 0.26 nanocuries and a half-life of 4.51 billion years), allowing the determination of the elapsed time since launch by measuring the amount of daughter elements to remaining U238. The 115 images on the disk were encoded in analog form. The sound selections (including greetings in 55 languages, 35 sounds, natural and man-made, and portions of 27 musical pieces) are designed for playback at 1000 rpm. The Voyagers were not the first spacecraft designed with such messages to the future. Pioneers 10 and 11, LAGEOS, and the Apollo landers also included plaques with a similar intent, though not quite so ambitious.\n\nMission Profile\n\nOriginally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.\n\nOriginally scheduled to launch twelve days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's launch was delayed twice to prevent the occurrence of problems which Voyager 2 experienced after launch. Voyager 1's launch finally happened on 05 Sept. 1977 and was termed \"flawless and accurate\".\n\nAlthough launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun. Voyager 1 then proceeded to Jupiter (making its closest approach on 05 March 1979) and Saturn (with closest approach on 12 Nov. 1980). Both prior to and after planetary encounters observations were made of the interplanetary medium. Some 18,000 images of Jupiter and its satellites were taken by Voyager 1. In addition, roughly 16,000 images of Saturn, its rings and satellites were obtained.\n\nAfter its encounter with Saturn, Voyager 1 remained relatively quiescent, continuing to make in situ observations of the interplanetary environment and UV observations of stars. After nearly nine years of dormancy, Voyager 1's cameras were once again turned on to take a series of pictures. On 14 Feb. 1990, Voyager 1 looked back from whence it came and took the first \"family portrait\" of the solar system, a mosaic of 60 frames of the Sun and six of the planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) as seen from \"outside\" the solar system. After this final look back, the cameras on Voyager 1 were once again turned off.\n\nAll of the experiments, save the photopolarimeter (which failed to operate), have produced useful data.\n\nOnward and Outward\n\nRechristened the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) by NASA in 1989 (after Voyager 2's Neptune encounter), Voyager 1 continues operations, taking measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field, plasma, and charged particle environment while searching for the heliopause (the distance at which the solar wind becomes subsumed by the more general interstellar wind). Through the end of the Neptune phase of the Voyager project, a total of $875 million had been expended for the construction, launch, and operations of both Voyager spacecraft. An additional $30 million was allocated for the first two years of VIM.\n\nVoyager 1 is speeding away from the Sun at a velocity of about 3.50 AU/year toward a point in the sky of RA= 262 degrees, Dec=+12 degrees (35.55 degrees ecliptic latitude, 260.78 degrees ecliptic longitude). Late on 17 February 1998, Voyager 1 became the most distant man-made object from the Sun, surpassing the distance of Pioneer 10."

The spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 10 rpm, with its spin axis in the equatorial plane, and offset from the Earth-sun line by about 20\u00b0 It could adjust attitude with both magnetic torquing and cold gas thrusters. The CCE used a 2.0e8-bit tape recorder and redundant 2.5 W S-band transponders. The spacecraft battery was charged by a 140 W solar array.\n\nThe PI for the U.S. AMPTE Program and for the CCE was S. M. Krimigis (now Richard McEntire of JHU/APL); each instrument was managed by a lead investigator.\n\nThe CCE encountered command module/power supply problems since the beginning of 1989, and failed as of 12 July 89. The three CCE particle instruments (CHEM, HPCE, MEPA) and two field instruments (MAG, PWE) collected data over the 4-year mission of August 1984 to January 1989 in a roughly 8 Re equatorial orbit which precessed over a range of apogee local times (apogee 8.8 Re, perigee 1100 km, inclination 4.8\u00b0, period 15.6 hours, spin vector in orbit plane 10\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 off of sun, spin rate 10.2 rpm).\n\nFor more details, see J.

        "Description": "The purpose of the AE-C mission was to investigate the thermosphere, with emphasis on the energy transfer and processes that govern its state. The study of photochemical processes accompanying the absorption of solar UV radiation in the earth's atmosphere was accomplished by making closely coordinated measurements of reacting constituents and the solar input. The AE-C spacecraft was a multi-sided polyhedron with a diameter of approximately 1.4 m. It weighed about 660 kg including 85 kg of instrumentation. The initial elliptical orbit was altered many times in the first year of life by means of an onboard propulsion system employing a 3.5-lb thruster. The purpose of these changes was to alter the perigee height to 129 km. After this period, the orbit was circularized and was raised periodically to about 390 km when it would decay to 250 km altitude. During the first year, the latitude of perigee moved from about 10 deg up to 68 deg north and then down to about 60 deg south. During this period about two cycles through all local times were completed. The spacecraft could be operated in either of two modes: spinning at a nominal 4 rpm or despun to 1 revolution per orbit. The spin axis was perpendicular to the orbit plane. Power was supplied by a solar cell array. The spacecraft used a PCM telemetry data system that operated in real time or in a tape recorder mode. The payload included instrumentation for the measurement of solar UV; the composition of positive ions and neutral particles; the density and temperature of neutral particles, positive ions and electrons; the measurement of airglow emissions, photoelectron energy spectra, and proton and electron fluxes up to 25 keV.

On 1st August 1997, the observatory became an independent research department of the University of Oulu.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Sodankyl\u00e4 Geophysical Observatory is located at 67\u00b0 22\u2032 N, 26\u00b0 38\u2032 E, which is 130 km north of Rovaniemi and 7 km south of Sodankyl\u00e4, in the middle of Finnish Lapland at the beautiful banks of the river Kitinen.\n\nObservations and Data\n\nThe Sodankyl\u00e4 Geophysical Observatory performs continuous measurements of the Earth's magnetic field, cosmic radio noise, seismic activities, and cosmic rays. The observatory operates two ionospheric radars and plays an active role in the scientific and technical research related to the EISCAT incoherent scatter radar system. An innovative measurement is the tomographic imaging of a 2-dimensional cross-section of the ionosphere from northern Norway to southern Finland. Altogether SGO runs measurements in 19 different locations from southern Finland to Svalbard.\n\nLocal magnetograms and the latest images from the All-Sky Camera are available in real time. Latest results of most continuous measurements are easily available. Descriptions of measurements and the recorded data can be found in the Archive. The data of measurements carried out by the Oulu Unit (seismic recordings and cosmic rays) can be found on the unit's web pages."

        "Description": "This spacecraft was one of a pair of deep space probes developed by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in a cooperative program with NASA. Experiments were provided by scientists from both FRG and the U.S. NASA supplied the Titan/Centaur launch vehicle. The spacecraft was equipped with two booms and a 32-m electric dipole. The payload consisted of a fluxgate magnetometer; electric and magnetic wave experiments, which covered various bands in the frequency range 6 Hz to 3 MHz; charged-particle experiments, which covered various energy ranges starting with solar wind thermal energies and extending to 1 GeV; a zodiacal-light experiment; and a micrometeoroid experiment. The purpose of the mission was to make pioneering measurements of the interplanetary medium from the vicinity of the earth's orbit to 0.3 AU. The spin axis was normal to the ecliptic, and the nominal spin rate was 1 rps. The outer spacecraft surface was dielectric, effectively (because of the sheath potential) raising the low-energy threshold for the solar wind plasma experiment to as high as 100 eV. Also, sheath-related coupling caused by the spacecraft antennae produced interference with the wave experiments. The spacecraft was capable of being operated at bit rates from 4096 to 8 bps, variable by factors of 2. While the spacecraft was moving to perihelion, it was generally operated from 64 to 256 bps; and near 0.3 AU, it was operated at the highest bit rate. Because of a deployment failure of one axis of the 32-m, tip-to-tip, dipole antenna, one axis was shorted, causing the antenna to function as a monopole. The major effect of this anomaly was to increase the effective instrument thresholds, and to introduce additional uncertainties in the effective antenna length. Instrument descriptions written by the experimenters were published (some in German, some in English) in Raumfahrtforschung, v. 19, n. 5, 1975."

The data (including both science data and spacecraft ephemeris/attitude information) from the two NASA-funded science instruments are publicly available to the scientific research community.\n\nTWINS is a stereo mission whose overall scientific objective is to establish the global connectivities and causal relationships between processes in different regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. To meet this goal, TWINS-1 and TWINS-2 provide stereoscopic neutral atom imaging of the magnetosphere from two widely spaced, high-altitude, high-inclination spacecraft.\n\nEach spacecraft carrying TWINS instruments is in a Molniya orbit (63.4 deg, 7.2 Re apogee, 1000 km perigee; period 12 h), and is three-axis stabilized and approximately nadir-pointing. Each acquires image data with time resolution of 60 s. The time required to change actuator direction between scans (no data collection) was 25 seconds from June 2008 to July 2009, and 12 seconds at all other times. This gives an effective cadence of 72 or 85 seconds. The nominal design lifetime for each instrument is four years. TWINS operates only during the apogee portion of each orbit, when the spacecraft is above the radiation belts."

        "Description": "The parachute on the Genesis sample return capsule failed to deploy on re-entry. The capsule crashed in the Utah desert. The fragments from the sample return container have been packaged for shipment to Johnson Space Center's curation facility in early October. Scientists are optimistic that they will be able to salvage useful data from the samples.\n\nThe primary objective of the Genesis mission is to collect samples of solar wind particles and return them to Earth for detailed analysis. The science objectives are to obtain precise measurements of solar isotopic and elemental abundances and provide a reservoir of solar matter for future scientific analysis. Specifically, the primary scientific objectives were to obtain precise measurements of isotope ratios of oxygen, nitrogen, and solar wind isotopic fractionation. Study of these samples will allow testing of theories of solar system formation and evolution and early nebular composition. A total sample mass of roughly 10 to 20 micrograms is expected.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe Genesis spacecraft has a launch mass of 636 kg, including 142 kg of fuel, and consists of a\n2.3 meter long, 2 meter wide spacecraft deck with two fixed solar panel wings with a\ntotal span of 7.9 meters and a sample return capsule mounted on top of\nthe deck. The spacecraft is spin stabilized at one revolution every 37.5\nseconds. Propulsion is provided by a hydrazine monopropellant thruster\nusing a helium pressurant. Communication is S-band via a fixed antenna.\nThe solar panels provide a maximum of 254 Watts power to a nickle-hydrogen storage battery. Temperatures\nare maintained by heaters and passive thermal control. The spacecraft is also\nequipped with ion and electron electrostatic monitors to determine which\nsolar wind regime is being encountered and to help set the appropriate\ncollector voltage. Spacecraft subsystems and monitors are mounted\nbeneath the sample return capsule.\n\nSample Return Capsule\n\nThe sample return capsule is disc-shaped with a blunt conical top and bottom, 1.5 meters\nin diameter and 1.31 meters high, with a total mass of about 225 kg.\nIt contains a 97.3 cm diameter science cannister which holds a\nconcentrator and three collector arrays. The collector arrays are flat\ndiscs made of ultra-pure silicon, silicon carbide, germanium, sapphire, chemically deposited diamond, gold, aluminum, and metallic glass wafers which are exposed to the solar\nwind. Isotopes of helium, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, radon, and other elements are implanted in the top 100 nm of these materials. The concentrator is an electrostatic\nmirror which concentrates elements up to neon by a factor of\napproximately 20. Each collector array is to be deployed for a different solar wind regime.\n\nMission Profile\n\nGenesis launched successfully at 16:13:40.324 UT on 8 August 2001 on a Delta 7326 (a Delta II Lite launch vehicle with three strap-on solid-rocket boosters and a Star 37FM third stage). Approximately 1 hour later the spacecraft left low Earth orbit on a three month journey out towards the L1 Lagrangian Sun-Earth libration point, 0.01 AU from Earth, to be inserted into a halo orbit about the L1 point. The L1 point is beyond the influences of the geomagnetic field and its trapped particles. Genesis reached the L1 point on 16 November 2001 and fired its hydrazine thrusters for 268 seconds to insert itself into the halo orbit at 19:03 UT (2:03 p.m. EST). On 3 December 2001 it opened its collector arrays and began gathering samples of solar wind particles. It completed 5 halo orbits over 30 months collecting samples. In April of 2004 it ended sample collection and shut the door to the sample collection cannister.\n\nThe samples were stowed and sealed in the contamination-tight canister within the Sample Return Capsule and returned to Earth over a five month period, flying past the Earth and then returning in order to be positioned for daylight entry. On 8 September 2004 the sample return capsule was released from the main spacecraft bus at about 12:00 UT and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere at 15:52:47 UT (11:53 a.m. EDT, 9:53 a.m. local MDT) and should have deployed a drogue parachute 2 minutes 7 seconds after entry at 33 km altitude. The parachute never deployed and the capsule crashed in the desert at a speed of 311 km/hr, severely damaging the capsule. The science cannister was removed to a clean room and the sample collection fragments are now ready to be shipped to Johnson Space Center. The cause of the parachute failure is believed to be incorrectly installed accelerometers which were to deploy the parachutes. The science team is confident that most of the planned science can be recovered from the salvaged sample collectors.\n\nThe spacecraft bus looped around Earth after the capsule was released and headed back out towards the L1 point.\n\nThe original plan for re-entry was as follows: Six minutes after drogue chute deployment the main parafoil was to deploy at an altitude of 6 km over the U.S.A.F. Utah Test and Training Range, where it would be aerocaptured by one of two specially equipped helicopters at an altitude of about 2.5 km. The spacecraft had the capability of going into a parking orbit if the weather at the capture site was unsuitable. The capsule was taken to a clean room at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground and will be transported to Johnson Space Center for contamination control and curation, and distributed to selected Advanced Analytical Instrument Facilities for analysis.\n\nThere was some concern that the sample return capsule battery would fail, jeopardizing the re-entry. The battery was overheating in space, but ground tests showed that the battery should have been unaffected by the amount of heating it had endured, and should have operated to deploy the parachute on reentry. The actual cause of the parachute deployment failure is not known at this time.\n\nGenesis was the fifth launch in NASA's Discovery program. The total cost of the project is $164 million for spacecraft development and science instruments and $45 million for operations and science data analysis."

The spacecraft was a solar-powered cylinder about 250 cm in diameter with its spin axis spin-stabilized perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. A high-gain antenna was mechanically despun to remain focused on the earth. The instruments were mounted on a shelf within the spacecraft except for a magnetometer mounted at the end of a boom to ensure against magnetic interference from the spacecraft. Pioneer Venus Orbiter measured the detailed structure of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of Venus, investigated the interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere and the magnetic field in the vicinity of Venus, determined the characteristics of the atmosphere and surface of Venus on a planetary scale, determined the planet's gravitational field harmonics from perturbations of the spacecraft orbit, and detected gamma-ray bursts. UV observations of comets have also been made. From Venus orbit insertion on December 4, 1978 to July 1980 periapsis was held between 142 and 253 km to facilitate radar and ionospheric measurements. Thereafter, the periapsis was allowed to rise (to 2290 km at maximum) and then fall, to conserve fuel. In 1991 the Radar Mapper was reactivated to investigate previously inaccessible southern portions of the planet. In May 1992 Pioneer Venus began the final phase of its mission, in which the periapsis was held between 150 and 250 km until the fuel ran out and atmospheric entry destroyed the spacecraft the following August. The orbiter cost $125 million to build and operate for the first 10 years. For further details see Colin, L. and Hunten, D. M., Space Science Reviews 20, 451, 1977."

        "Description": "Voyager 1 and 2 was a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nEach Voyager consisted of a decahedral bus, 47 cm in height and 1.78 m across from flat to flat. A 3.66 m diameter parabolic high-gain antenna was mounted on top of the bus. The major portion of the science instruments were mounted on a science boom extending out some 2.5 m from the spacecraft. At the end of the science boom was a steerable scan platform on which were mounted the imaging and spectroscopic remote sensing instruments. Also mounted at various distances along the science boom were the plasma and charged particle detectors. The magnetometers were located along a separate boom extending 13 m on the side opposite the science boom. A third boom, extending down and away from the science instruments, held the spacecraft's radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Two 10 m whip antennas (used for the plasma wave and planetary radio astronomy investigations) also extended from the spacecraft, each perpendicular to the other. The spacecraft was three-axis spin stabilized to enable long integration times and selective viewing for the instruments mounted on the scan platform.\n\nPower was provided to the spacecraft systems and instruments through the use of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The RTGs were assembled in tandem on a deployable boom hinged on an outrigger arrangement of struts attached to the basic structure. Each RTG unit, contained in a beryllium outer case, was 40.6 cm in diameter, 50.8 cm in length, and weighed 39 kg. The RTGs used a radioactive source (Plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium oxide, or PuO2, in this case) which, as it decayed, gave off heat. A bi-metallic thermoelectric device was used to convert the heat to electric power for the spacecraft. The total output of RTGs slowly decreases with time as the radioactive material is expended. Therefore, although the initial output of the RTGs on Voyager was approximately 470 W of 30 V DC power at launch, it had fallen off to approximately 335 W by the beginning of 1997 (about 19.5 years post-launch). As power continues to decrease, power loads on the spacecraft must also decrease. Current estimates (1998) are that increasingly limited instrument operations can be carried out at least until 2020.\n\nCommunications were provided through the high-gain antenna with a low-gain antenna for backup. The high-gain antenna supported both X-band and S-band downlink telemetry. Voyager was the first spacecraft to utilize X-band as the primary telemetry link frequency. Data could be stored for later transmission to Earth through the use of an on-board digital tape recorder.\n\nVoyager, because of its distance from Earth and the resulting time-lag for commanding, was designed to operate in a highly-autonomous manner. In order to do this and carry out the complex sequences of spacecraft motions and instrument operations, three interconnected on-board computers were utilized. The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) was responsible for storing commanding for the other two computers and issuing the commands at set times. The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) was responsible for controlling spacecraft attitude and motions of the scan platform. The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) controlled the instruments, including changes in configuration (state) or telemetry rates. All three computers had redundant components to ensure continued operations. The AACS included redundant star trackers and Sun sensors as well.\n\nMessage in a Bottle\n\nEach Voyager has mounted to one of the sides of the bus a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk. The disk has recorded on it sounds and images of Earth designed to portray the diversity of life and culture on the planet. Each disk is encased in a protective aluminum jacket along with a cartridge and a needle. Instructions explaining from where the spacecraft originated and how to play the disk are engraved onto the jacket. Electroplated onto a 2 cm area on the cover is also an ultra-pure source of uranium-238 (with a radioactivity of about 0.26 nanocuries and a half-life of 4.51 billion years), allowing the determination of the elapsed time since launch by measuring the amount of daughter elements to remaining U238. The 115 images on the disk were encoded in analog form. The sound selections (including greetings in 55 languages, 35 sounds, natural and man-made, and portions of 27 musical pieces) are designed for playback at 1000 rpm. The Voyagers were not the first spacecraft designed with such messages to the future. Pioneers 10 and 11, LAGEOS, and the Apollo landers also included plaques with a similar intent, though not quite so ambitious."

Spacecraft design, manufacturing and\n        testing were provided by the Max-Planck-Institut fur Extraterrestrische Physik (MPE). The project was financially supported by DARA\n        (Deutsche Agentur fur Raumfahrt Angelegenheiten). Some assistance and in-kind contributions were received from ESA/ESTEC and NASA.\n        Mission analysis and operations are the responsibility of the German Space Operations Center (GSOC) of the DLR. The spacecraft was\n        launched December 2, 1997, as a secondary payload on an Ariane IV vehicle from Kourou (French Guiana). Equator-S is different from\n        NASA's ISTP/EQUATOR spacecraft, which was dropped when the ISTP mission was re-scoped in late 1989. \n \n  The Equator-S objectives are to\n        provide high-resolution plasma, magnetic, and electric field measurements in several regions not adequately covered by the existing\n        ISTP missions, namely the low-latitude dayside magnetopause and its boundary layer, the equatorial ring current region, and the near-earth\n        equatorial plasma sheet. These regions play key roles for our understanding of the global perspective of solar-terrestrial relations as\n        well as the detailed plasmaphysical processes.\n \n  The orbit is near-equatorial, with 500 km perigee altitude and 11 Re geocentric apogee\n        distance. The payload consists of seven scientific instruments provided by international groups to study the solar wind and charged\n        particles trapped in the earth's magnetosphere. For reasons of cost and schedule, these instruments are largely derived from engineering\n        or spare units from other ISTP missions. Innovative sub-systems for solar power and orbit measurement are tested on Equator-S for the\n        benefit of future spacecraft designs. Furthermore, some technological experiments have been added that exploit the hard radiation\n        environment of the Equator-S orbit or make use of its orbital features. These include a GaAs solar cell to check on temperature and\n        I/V - characteristics, and degradation by radiation; and a GPS receiver to study the GPS capabilities as a function of spacecraft\n        altitude. There is also a mass memory of 192 MBytes of CMOS RAM for temporary data storage.\n\n        The rapid spacecraft spin rate (60 rpm) allows unprecedented high temporal resolution of the measurements. At the regular telemetry\n        contact with the Weilheim ground-station on 1 May 1998, EQUATOR-S stopped sending data, although the TM-signal was unchanged.\n        This is attributed to a failure of the redundant processor, similar to the failure of the first processor on 17 December 1997.\n        All attempts to command the spacecraft failed. However, GSOC will continue this effort. If a latch-up caused by penetrating particle\n        radiation was the cause of the failure, there is hope that it may heal itself upon the next eclipse (August 1998) because of the complete\n        temporary switch-off of the electrical system.     \n"

POLAR has two despun gimbaled instrument platforms, and booms are deployed along both Z axes. Data are stored using on-board tape recorders and are relayed to the Deep Space Network at 600 kbps maximum (250 kbps nominal) although the average real-time data rate for POLAR is 41.6 kbps. POLAR has a 22.6-h polar orbit (90 deg inclination), with perigee and apogee of 11,500 and 57,000 km. Polar was launched to observe the polar magnetosphere and, as its orbit has precessed with time, has observed the equatorial inner magnetosphere and is now carrying out an extended period of southern hemisphere coverage.

The data (including both science data and spacecraft ephemeris/attitude information) from the two NASA-funded science instruments are publicly available to the scientific research community.\n\nTWINS is a stereo mission whose overall scientific objective is to establish the global connectivities and causal relationships between processes in different regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. To meet this goal, TWINS-1 and TWINS-2 provide stereoscopic neutral atom imaging of the magnetosphere from two widely spaced, high-altitude, high-inclination spacecraft.\n\nEach spacecraft carrying TWINS instruments is in a Molniya orbit (63.4 deg, 7.2 Re apogee, 1000 km perigee; period 12 h), and is three-axis stabilized and approximately nadir-pointing. Each acquires image data with time resolution of 60 s. The time required to change actuator direction between scans (no data collection) was 25 seconds from June 2008 to July 2009, and 12 seconds at all other times. This gives an effective cadence of 72 or 85 seconds. The nominal design lifetime for each instrument is four years. TWINS operates only during the apogee portion of each orbit, when the spacecraft is above the radiation belts."

The main objectives of SAMPEX experiments was to obtained data for several continuous years on the anomalous components of cosmic rays, on solar energetic particles emissions from the sun, and on the precipitating magnetospheric relativistic electrons. The orbit of SAMPEX has an altitude of 512 by 687 km and an 81.7 degree inclination. The spacecraft uses an on-board 3-axis stabilized solar pointed/momentum bias system with the pitch axis pointed to towards the sun. Solar panels provide power for operations, including 16.7 W for science instruments. An on-board DPU preprocesses the science and other data and stores them in a RPP unit of about 65 Mb, before transmitting in the S-band at a rate of 1.5 Mb/s over Wallops (or a back-up) station. The command memory can store at least a thousand commands. The science instruments generally point toward local zenith, especially over the terrestrial poles, for optimal sampling of galactic and solar cosmic ray flux. Energetic magnetospheric particle precipitation is monitored at lower geomagnetic latitudes. It carries four science instruments: (1) low energy ion composition analyzer (LICA); (2) heavy ion large telescope (HILT); (3) mass spectrometer telescope (MAST); and (4) proton electron telescope (PET). Estimated useful lifetime of the spacecraft was about three years; however, the data stream continue to July, 2004. In 1997, NASA Goddard transferred operation of SAMPEX to the Flight Dynamics and Control Laboratory (FDCL) housed within the Aerospace Engineering Department of the University of Maryland.

The spacecraft was launched September 21, 1981, in a near-polar orbit. The center portion of the spacecraft was a pressurized cylinder 1.6 m in diameter and 2.7 m in height. Extending from the central body and deployed after launch were the telemetry and command antennas, the solar panels, and six booms holding various sensors away from the spacecraft. Magnetic torquing and gravity gradient were utilized to achieve three-axis stabilization. The Z axis of the spacecraft was aimed toward the center of the earth, the X axis was the direction of the spacecraft velocity vector. Both passive and active thermal control were used. Eight solar panels and 28-V batteries provided a maximum power of 250 W, and an average power of 50 W. The spacecraft carried a total of 12 experiments (4 from the USSR, 7 from France, and 1 done jointly by France and the USSR). The overall objectives were to provide some answers to the numerous questions related to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling at high latitudes. The phenomena of interest included aurorae, magnetospheric substorms, origin and transport of plasmas, associated energies, electric currents, and electric fields. The experiments planned to meet these objectives included measurements of ambient electron density, electron temperature, and plasma velocity; of charged particles over the range 0.1 eV to 255 keV, plus electrons with energies above 40 keV and protons with energies above 500 keV; of dc electric and magnetic fields (0 to 10 Hz); of ELF and VLF waves in the range 0.01 to 16 kHz; of electric fields at frequencies from 0.1 to 16 MHz; and of auroral photometry at 4278 A, 4861 A, and 6300 A. Commands were either carried out in real time or stored on a weekly basis. Two instruments were used for onboard processing of experimental data. The correlometer provided cross-correlation and autocorrelation data for the measurement from either the four Kukushka detectors (81-094A-01) or two Kukushka and two Pietstchanka (81-094A-02) detectors. The ONTCH-2ME instrument provided onboard processing of the data from the ISO F (81-094A-09) and ISO M (81-094A-10) experiments. Two telemetry systems were used, a direct read-out system used over French telemetry stations and a delayed read-out system that used tape-recording and play back over the Soviet telemetry stations. The routine scheduling of operations for the French experiments was initiated weekly (on Fridays), 24 days in advance. It was coordinated through the French Centre d'Operations Specialise ARCAD 3 (COS A3) and forwarded to the Institute for Space Research (IKI), Moscow, where it was merged with the input from the Russian experimenters. It was then returned to France for concurrence and returned to IKI Moscow 11 days prior to the beginning of operations. The schedule was then finalized and distributed 5 days prior to the beginning of operations."

        "Description": "The Fast Auroral SnapshoT Explorer (FAST) was successfully\n   launched on 1996-08-21 into its intended orbit. FAST investigates the\n   plasma physics of auroral phenomena at extremely high time and spatial\n   resolution using the full complement of particle and fields instruments.\n   FAST is the second spacecraft (SAMPEX was first) in the Small Explorer\n   (SMEX) program at NASA-GSFC. SMEX was established to provide rapid (3 year\n   development) low cost ($35M development) mission opportunities (1 per year)\n   to the space science community using a single designated Principal\n   Investigator (PI).\n\n      In order to capture the auroral phenomena over small time (microseconds) and spatial\n      scales, FAST utilizes high speed data sampling, a large, fast-loading (\"burst\")\n      memory, and a smart, on-board software to trigger on the appearance of various\n      key phenomena. Using a 1 Gb solid-state memory and a data acquisition rate of 8\n      Mbs (almost two orders of magnitude faster than previous satellites), FAST\n      produces high-resolution \"snapshots\" of auroral arcs and other interesting auroral\n      events. FAST flies in a highly eccentric, near-polar orbit precessing nominally\n      one degree per day. Scientific investigations are operate in a campaign mode\n      (about 60 days long) as apogee transitions through the northern auroral zone and\n      in less intense survey mode during the rest of the orbit.\n\n      The FAST mission uses a unique (not a SAMPEX derivative), lightweight, orbit-normal\n      spinner spacecraft developed by the SMEX project. The spacecraft has body-mounted\n      solar arrays, and is spin-stabilized, rotating at 12 rpm with the spin axis normal\n      to the orbit plane (\"cartwheel\"). The four FAST experiments are: (1) the\n      Electrostatic Analyzers (ESA) for measuring the electron and ion distribution\n      function, (2) the Time-of-flight Energy Angle Mass Spectrograph (TEAMS) for\n      measuring the full 3-dimensional distribution function of the major ion species,\n      (3) the Tri-Axial Fluxgate and Search-coil Magnetometers for measuring magnetic\n      field data, and (4) the Electric Field/Langmuir Probe Instrument for obtaining\n      electric field data and plasma density and temperature. The FAST electric field\n      instrument stopped providing meaningful data around 2002, all other instruments\n      and systems continue to function nominally."

It is identical to Sakigake apart from its payload: a CCD UV imaging system and a solar wind instrument. The main objective of the mission was to take UV images of the hydrogen corona for about 30 days before and after Comet Halley's downward crossing of the ecliptic plane. Solar wind parameters were measured for a much longer time period. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized at two different rates measured in revolutions per minute, rpm: 5 rpm and 0.2 rpm, respectively. Hydrazine thrusters are used for attitude and velocity control. Star and sun sensors are for attitude control. And, a mechanically despun off-set parabolic dish is used for long range communication. Suisei began UV observations in Novembber 1985, generating up to 6 images per day. The spacecraft encountered Comet P/Halley at 151,000 km on sunward side during March 8, 1986 while suffering only two dust impacts. Fifteen burns of the Suisei 3 N motors over the time interval spanning April 5-10 of 1987 yielded a 65 m/s velocity increase for a 60,000 km Earth gravity assist swingby on August 20, 1992, although the craft was then lost behind the Sun for the summer. The hydrazine was depleted on 22 February 1991. Preliminary tracking indicated a 900,000 km flyby had been achieved. ISAS had decided during 1987 to guide Suisei to a November 24, 1998 encounter with P/Giacobini-Zinner, but due to depletion of the hydrazine, this, as well as plans to fly within several million km of Comet P/Tempel-Tuttle on February 28, 1998 were been cancelled."

The main objective is to study the physical mechanisms responsible for the transmission of solar wind energy to the magnetosphere, its storage there, and subsequent dissipation in the tail and auroral regions of the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere during magnetospheric substorms. A ground-based support group will provide coordinated and simultaneous ground-based data of many types, including observations from auroral and polar cap regions. Interball is an IACG-related mission. Key physical parameters will be generated, and will be available for exchange with other projects.\n\n          One pair of spacecraft, Tail Probe and its subsatellite S2-X (X for the first letter of the Russian word for ``Tail''), will be launched into the magnetospheric tail. The second pair, Auroral Probe and S2-A (A for ``Auroral''), will have an orbit that crosses the auroral oval to observe the acceleration of auroral particles and the flow of electric currents that connect the magnetospheric tail with the conducting ionosphere. To study the equilibrium tail structure, during about half of each year the Tail Probe pair will cross the main parts of the magnetotail every four days. The Auroral Probe pair will support the Tail Probe pair with auroral region measurements.\n\n          Each main spacecraft has more than twenty scientific instruments. The spacecraft is cylindrical, with spin axis toward the sun (within 10 degrees), and with spin period of ~120 s. The electric and magnetic field sensors are on booms connected to the ends of the solar panels. The subsatellites are small, each with about ten scientific instruments. The spin axis will be directed within 10 degrees of the sun, with a spin period of ~120 s, as with the main spacecraft. The subsatellites also carry gas-jet thrusters for limited control of the orbit. Separation distance will range from hundreds of kilometers to several tens of thousands of kilometers for the Tail Probe pair. Separation distance will range from hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers for the Auroral Probe pair.\n\n          The Tail Probe has two telemetry systems, at up to 32 Kbps in real-time, with a memory mode capacity of 30 Mb in the RTK telemetry system and 120 Mb in the SSNI system. The Auroral Probe has similar capability plus the additional real-time-only STO system, capable of 40 Kbps. Each subsatellite has only the STO real-time telemetry system. For S2-X the rate can be varied from 2--40 kbps. The Tail Probe has an adapting alert mode while in the memory mode, allowing time resolutions that are the same as in the real-time mode. The aim is to have the highest time resolution available at the thin borders of magnetospheric regions or the sharp borders of some features. In the alert mode (triggered by an on-board computer monitoring plasma and field parameters), the bit rate is increased for plasma, field, and wave measurements. The duration of these alert periods is about 10 minutes, and there can be 5--6 of them during one orbit."

Initially, balloon launches were planned from the South African Antarctic station, SANAE IV, and the British station, Halley Bay, with an option for later northern hemisphere campaigns. During each BARREL campaign, five to eight long-duration (5 day to 10 day) balloon payloads weighing about 20 kg would be released to rise to an altitude of 30 km to 35 km. The plan involves balloon releases sequentially every few days so that the balloons would be aloft simultaneously for about a one month time interval. Each balloon will carry a NaI scintillator to measure the Bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by precipitating relativistic electrons as they collide with neutrals in Earth's atmosphere to allow an estimate of the total electron loss from the radiation belts. The payload also includes a DC magnetometer. Besides the two scientific instruments, each payload includes solar panels generating 6 W and an onboard battery for power, a number of sensors to monitor the operation of the payload, a GPS receiver to track the position and altitude of the balloon, and an Iridium satellite link that transfer all data at a rate of 2 kps.\n\nBARREL is the first NASA Living with a Star, LWS, Geospace Mission of Opportunity, MO. The BARREL mission is designed to augment the measurements from the NASA Van Allen Probes by measuring the precipitation of relativistic electrons from the radiation belts. Observations are planned for when the balloon array will be conjugate with the NASA Van Allen Probes spacecraft, such that direct comparison is possible between the observations collected in space and in the stratosphere."

The current Cluster II mission is a\n   near-replica of the original four-spacecraft mission lost at launch in 1996. (NSSDC will carry the\n   name \"Cluster96\" in its information files to designate the unsuccessful 1996 four-spacecraft Ariane\n   5 launch.) The purpose of the Cluster II mission is to study small-scale structures in three\n   dimensions in the Earth's plasma environment, such as those involved in the interaction between the\n   solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma, in global magnetotail dynamics, in cross-tail currents,\n   and in the formation and dynamics of the neutral line and of plasmoids.\n\nThe four Cluster II spacecraft will orbit in a tetrahedral formation in near-polar orbits of nominally\n4 x 19.6 Earth radii, with period about 57 hours, and inclination about 90.7 degrees. Relative distances\nbetween the spacecraft will be adjusted in the course of the mission, depending on the spatial scales of\nthe structures to be studied, varying from a few hundred km to a few Earth radii. The tetrahedral formation\nis essential for making three-dimensional measurements and for determining the curl of vectorial quantities\nsuch as the magnetic field.\n\nThe orbits of all four spacecraft will be frequently maneuvered so as to achieve the targeted investigations.\n\nEach spacecraft will be spin-stabilized, normally at around 15 rpm, and will be cylindrical in shape,\nwith a 2.9-m diameter and 1.3-m length. It will have two rigid 5-m radial experiment booms, four 50-m\nexperiment wire booms, and two axial telecommunications antenna booms. Telemetry downlink bit rate will\nbe 2 to 262 kbit/s.\n\nEach spacecraft will have AC and DC magnetometers, an electric fields and waves sensor, an electron\nemitter/detector, an electron density sounder, electron and ion plasma analysers, an energetic particle\ndetector, an ion emitter, and a data processing unit.\n\nCluster operations will be performed by ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany, with support from NASA's Deep Space\nNetwork. Cluster is also an IACG mission. The scientific data are distributed by ESOC using CD-ROM as a\nmedium to the Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators and the network of eight national data centres\n(6 in Europe, 1 in USA and 1 in China) that form the Cluster Science Data System (CSDS). There are\napproximately 80 recipients world-wide. Science operations are carried out by the Joint Science Operations\nCentre, co-located with the UK data centre at RAL, Didcot.

IMAGE was launched March 25, 2000 into a highly elliptical polar orbit with initial geocentric apogee of 8.2 Earth radii and perigee altitude of 1000 km. IMAGE used neutral atom, ultraviolet, and radio imaging techniques to: (a) identify the dominant mechanisms for injecting plasma into the magnetosphere on substorm and magnetic storm time scales; (b) determine the directly driven response of the magnetosphere to solar wind changes; and, (c) discover how and where magnetospheric plasmas are energized, transported, and subsequently lost during substorms and magnetic storms.\n\nIn order to fulfill its science goals, IMAGE utilized neutral atom, ultraviolet, and radio imaging techniques. A suite of three neutral atom imagers (NAI) provided energy- and composition-resolved images at energies from 10 eV to 200 keV with a time resolution of 300 seconds. Two ultraviolet imagers, covering wavelength ranges from 120-180 nm (FUV) and 30.4 nm (EUV), provided coverage in the far and extreme ultraviolet. The radio plasma imager (RPI) was a low-power radar which operated in the radio frequency bands which contain the plasma resonance frequencies characteristic of the Earth's magnetophere (3 kHz to 3 MHz).\n\nOn December 18, 2005, after 5.8 years of successful operations, IMAGE's telemetry signals were not received during a routine pass. Preliminary analysis indicated that IMAGE's solid state power controller (SSPC) on the 28V line from the power distribution unit (PDU) to the transponder is reading closed, but is actually open resulting in having no power to the transponder to get a command to the PDU to close it. The only thing that might close it would be a PDU power cycle. It is possible that the next mega-eclipse cycle in October 2007, may drain the battery and voltage enough to cause this to happen enabling IMAGE to be recovered.

The first seven bands pertain, respectively, to\n   emissions from Ar, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, K, Ni, and the last is a continuum.\n  \n   The IRIS experiment\n   (Investigator: Kocharov, PTI) aims to monitor hard X-ray flares in the 2.0-200 keV energy range\n   at temporal resolution of 0.01-2.5 seconds, with a sensitivity of 10 nanoergs/sq-cm/sec.\n   The sensitivity in the 2-15 keV is high enough to capture microflares and precursors in a number\n   of small width channels.\n  \n   The HELIKON instrument (Investigator: E. P. Mazets, PTI) is to capture\n   high energy X-rays and Gamma rays in the range 10 keV-8 MeV. It carries two detectors, one pointing\n   to the Sun and the other in the anti-solar direction to monitor the energy range in 128 channels,\n   and with 4,096 channels to cover the lower range of 10 keV-1.0 MeV.\n  \n   The SKL instrument\n   (Investigator: S. N. Kuznetsov, NIIYaF-MSU) has three components. The SONG is to measure solar Gamma\n   rays in the 0.03-100 MeV band through a total of 250 channels, the neutrons in the range 3.0-100 MeV\n   through five channels, and electrons in the 11-108 MeV range through six channels. The second component,\n   MKL is to capture protons in the range 1-300 MeV, electrons in the 0.5-12 MeV, protons at >10 MeV,\n   and electrons at >1.3 MeV.

It has a channel for 1.5-19 MeV protons.\n  \n   The RES-K instrument (Investogator: I. A. Zhitnik (LPI) is a X-ray spectroheliograph to provide high\n   resolution images of the solar disk using the emission lines of FeXXIV and FeXXV in the 18.5\n   -18.7 nm, and the MgXII line in the 84.1-84.3 nm range. Images in the emission lines covering\n   1800-2050 nm and 2850-3350 nm will also be obtained by scanning the range in widths of 0.3 nm.\n   The images will be at a spatial resolution of six arc-sec. Each full-disk image is to be produced\n   in about six seconds.\n  \n   The RPS instrument (Investigator: V. M. Pankov, IKI, and Yu. D. Kotov, MEPHI)\n   is an X-ray spectrometer covering the 3-30 keV band in steps of 1.5 keV. The range includes the Fe55\n   line at 5.9 keV. The detector width is 0.5 sq-cm.\n  \n   Lastly, the SPR-N instrument (Investigator: I.\n   Sobelman, FIAN, and S. Kuznetsov, NIIYAF) is a X-ray polarimeter to measure nonthermal/synchrotron\n   emissions in solar flares in the energy ranges 20-40, 40-60, and 60-100 keV range at a sensitivity\n   of one microerg/sq-cm/sec.\n  \n   More details may be obtained via\n   http://www.izmiran.rssi.ru/projects/CORONAS/F/. CORONAS is an international project prepared in\n   cooperation between Russian and Ukranian space agencies and Academies of sciences. Taking part in\n   the project are also Poland, Germany, Slovakia, France, United Kingdom and USA.\n  \n   A similar version\n   of this observatory, CORONAS-I (KORONAS-I, 1994-041A) was launched in 1994, but its functionality\n   was crippled by orientation control failure a few months after launch.\n"

The GOES-NEXT series is a joint effort on the part of NASA and NOAA to provide continued operational monitoring of weather systems primarily over the United States, distribute meteorological data to regional and national weather offices within the USA, contribute to the development of an environmental data collection network, contribute to the search and rescue program, improve the capability for forcasting and provide real-time warnings of solar distrubances, and to extend knowledge and understanding of atmospheric processes to improve short and long-term weather forecasts.\n\nThe GOES-NEXT series extends the capabilities of the previous GOES 1-7 spacecraft. The GOES I-M spacecraft will be placed over the equator at 135 deg West or 75 deg West. The design allows unobstructed views of the Earth for operational coverage by the spacecraft sensors. The spacecraft configuration is a compact box-shaped main body that carries the Earth-observing instruments, a continuous-drive solar array attached to the south panel through a yoke assembly, and a solar pointing instrument gimbal mounted on the solar panel yoke. The main body accomodates the sensors, electronics, and support subsystems. The communication antennas, except the Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&C) antenna, are hard-mounted to the Earth-facing panel. The Propulsion Module consists of the fuel and oxidizer tanks for the bipropellant propulsion subsystem mounted on the central cylinder. The Attitude and Orbit Control Substem (AOCS) provides attitude control of the spacecraft. The AOCS consists of the sensors, electronics, and the actuators. The GOES power is generated from the solar array and two 12 A-hr batteries. Power is automatically regulated during solar eclipses. A conical shaped solar sail at the end of a 58-foot boom balances torque caused by solar radiation. The main body of the spacecraft is a 2-meter cube. In its deployed orbit configuration, the overall length is about 27 meters. Initial mass was about 4640 pounds, including fuel. Design lifetime is about five years.\n\nThe Image Navigation/Registration (INR) system provides Imager and Sounder data products in real-time to users. The Communications, Command, and Data Handling subsystem is comprised of antennas, receivers, transponders, transmitters, data encoders and encryptors and multiplexers. The Tracking Telemetry and Command (TT&C) subsystem provides the necessary monitor and command link between the spacecraft and the ground stations.\n\nThe GOES-NEXT instruments consist of the following: (1) Earth Imaging System, a 5-channel visible and infrared radiometer which provides Earth imagery 24 hours a day; (2) Sounding System, a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer for obtaining atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings; (3) a Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which consists of a magnetic field sensor, a solar X-ray sensor, an energetic particle sensor (EPS), and a High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD); (4) a Search and Rescue subsystem (SARSAT), which receives signals from 406 MHz distress beacons and relays them to the ground; (5) a Data Collection System (DCS) for collecting and relaying real-time information from Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) such as buoys, balloons, remote weather stations, ships, and aircraft; and (6) a Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) system which relays processed weather imagery from the Wallops Island station to the user community.\n\nThe SEC package has been frequently eratic during 2003.\n"

The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and\n   230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the\n   cylindrical shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust\n   tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the earth through a\n   special aperture in the side of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially from the\n   thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft\n   to provide the primary source of electrical power. Located in the annulus-shaped space between the\n   thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries,\n   and most of the SEM equipment. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm)\n   were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and\n   activated by ground command. The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its\n   telemetry and command subsystem. A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command\n   during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft had\n   attained synchronous orbit. When GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure on July 30, 1984, GOES 4 was\n   reactivated by NOAA to provide GOES 1 VISSR data relay services to western users."

        "Description": "DMSP 5D-2/F8 is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the\n   Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Its pre-launch designation was DMSP\n   5D-2/S9. This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified\n   until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data\n   and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and\n   forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar\n   orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon.\n   The local time nodes for DMSP F8 are 06:00 and 18:00.\n  \n   The 6.4-m-long\n   spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment\n   requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels,\n   and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the\n   third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m\n   solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control\n   coil system so sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode.

The\n   microwave imager (SSMI) and sounders (SSMT1, SSMT2) cover one half the width of the visible and\n   infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once\n   per day. The space environment sensors (SSJ, SSM, SSIES) record along-track plasma densities,\n   velocities, composition and drifts (SS stands for Special Sensor).\n\n\n   DMSP F16 carries two new experiments: the limb scanning ultraviolet imager/spectrometer SSULI built\n   by the Naval Research Laboratory and the nadir scanning ultaviolet imager/spectrometer and photometer\n   SSUSI built by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. It also carried new versions\n   of the Special Sensor for Ions, Electrons and Scintillations (SSIES-13) and of the precipitating ion\n   and electron monitor (SSJ-5)\n\n\n   The data from the DMSP satellites are received and used at operational centers continuously. The data\n   are sent to the National Geophysical Data Center's Solar Terrestrial Physics Division (NGDC/STP) by\n   the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for creation of an archive.\n"

The same processes operate within our immediate environment, the inner magnetosphere and Earth's natural particle accelerator. The Living With a Star (LWS) program's RBSP mission will provide the in situ observations needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of these fundamental processes. The two-year RBSP mission offers local time, altitude, and geomagnetic activity coverage sufficient to sample a wide range of energetic particle events, to identify the underlying physical processes, and to determine their relative significances and interaction modes. In addition, the mission will quantify the time-varying structure and processes of the inner magnetosphere, identify source populations, and determine when and where relevant plasma waves are generated. The knowledge gained from the RBSP mission will aid in developing both empirical and predictive models that can be used to safeguard astronauts and spacecraft in near-Earth orbit and future exploration missions to Mars and the other planets. Discriminating between proposed interaction mechanisms, distinguishing between energetic charged particle source and loss regions, and determining the spatial extent of the various phenomena manifested in the radiation belts requires simultaneous observations over a wide range of spacecraft separations. To accomplish this task, the RBSP mission will operate two Earth-orbiting spacecraft in near-equatorial, eccentric orbits with somewhat different apogees and orbital periods to provide a variety of radial and local time separations between the spacecraft over the course of the mission. The orbits of the spacecraft must be near-equatorial to observe full particle pitch angle distributions with respect to the magnetic field within the radiation belts and to observe processes that are confined to regions near the magnetic equator. The instruments must make charged particle observations over energies ranging from those of the source population (as low as 1 eV) to those representative of the most energetic particles within the radiation belts (1 GeV). Distinguishing between source populations, identifying the predominant contributors to the ring current, and understanding wave-particle interaction modes requires ion composition measurements over energies ranging from 1 eV to 1000 keV. Understanding the transport and energization of relativistic particles within the inner magnetosphere requires observations of the slowly evolving DC electric and magnetic fields. Identification of wave-particle interaction modes that lead to both particle acceleration and loss requires observations of 3D wave electric and magnetic fields over the full range of frequencies capable of interacting with particles (nominally, 10 Hz to 12 kHz for the Earth's inner magnetosphere). Finally, plasma densities governing the structure of the inner magnetosphere are best determined from combined observations of low energy (<1 keV) ions, the spacecraft potential, and plasma wave resonances to 400 kHz."

The Data from the Array has contributed to the Publication of Hundreds of Scientific Papers and helped to establish CARISMA as an essential International Resource for Magnetospheric Physics.\n\nThe CARISMA Network is an Array of Magnetometers, which are Devices that are used to measure Disturbances in the Magnetic Field of the Earth, caused by Activity occurring in a Region of Space near the Earth, known as the Magnetosphere. From these Measurements, the Nature of the Event can be determined and, by using a Distributed Array of Magnetometers, more Information can be calculated about their Temporal and Spatial Evolution.\n\nThe CARISMA Array spans a Range of Longitude from Dawson City, YK (near the Alaska Border, 220.89\u00b0E) to Rankin Inlet, NU (267.89\u00b0E) and a Range of Latitude from Taloyoak, NU (69.54\u00b0N) to Osakis, MN, USA (45.87\u00b0N). Currently most of these Sites are on a North-South Meridian known as the 'Churchill Line' By arranging the Magnetometers in this way, it is possible to investigate the Radial Propagation of Events, because the Magnetic Field measured at Higher Latitudes is affected by Regions further from the Earth than those measured at Lower Latitudes."

The Data from the Array has contributed to the Publication of Hundreds of Scientific Papers and helped to establish CARISMA as an essential International Resource for Magnetospheric Physics.\n\nThe CARISMA Network is an Array of Magnetometers, which are Devices that are used to measure Disturbances in the Magnetic Field of the Earth, caused by Activity occurring in a Region of Space near the Earth, known as the Magnetosphere. From these Measurements, the Nature of the Event can be determined and, by using a Distributed Array of Magnetometers, more Information can be calculated about their Temporal and Spatial Evolution.\n\nThe CARISMA Array spans a Range of Longitude from Dawson City, YK (near the Alaska Border, 220.89\u00b0E) to Rankin Inlet, NU (267.89\u00b0E) and a Range of Latitude from Taloyoak, NU (69.54\u00b0N) to Osakis, MN, USA (45.87\u00b0N). Currently most of these Sites are on a North-South Meridian known as the 'Churchill Line' By arranging the Magnetometers in this way, it is possible to investigate the Radial Propagation of Events, because the Magnetic Field measured at Higher Latitudes is affected by Regions further from the Earth than those measured at Lower Latitudes."

The long profile covering geographic latitudes from 51 to 79 degrees \n\t\t  is especially favourable for electrojet studies. Together with other ground-based \n\t\t  recordings (by radars, riometers, all-sky cameras) and satellite observations, \n\t\t  IMAGE is an essential part in the investigations of high-latitude \n\t\t  magnetospheric-ionospheric physics. Together with its predecessor, the EISCAT \n\t\t  magnetometer cross started in 1982, IMAGE also provides high-quality data useful \n\t\t  for studies of geomagnetic induction and long-term geomagnetic activity in the \n\t\t  auroral region.

During each BARREL campaign, five to eight long-duration (5 day to 10 day) balloon payloads weighing about 20 kg would be released to rise to an altitude of 30 km to 35 km. The plan involves balloon releases sequentially every few days so that the balloons would be aloft simultaneously for about a one month time interval.

Besides the two scientific instruments, each payload includes solar panels generating 6 W and an onboard battery for power, a number of sensors to monitor the operation of the payload, a GPS receiver to track the position and altitude of the balloon, and an Iridium satellite link that transfer all data at a rate of 2 kps.\n\nBARREL is the first NASA Living with a Star, LWS, Geospace Mission of Opportunity, MO.

During each BARREL campaign, five to eight long-duration (5 day to 10 day) balloon payloads weighing about 20 kg would be released to rise to an altitude of 30 km to 35 km. The plan involves balloon releases sequentially every few days so that the balloons would be aloft simultaneously for about a one month time interval. Each balloon will carry a NaI scintillator to measure the Bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by precipitating relativistic electrons as they collide with neutrals in Earth's atmosphere to allow an estimate of the total electron loss from the radiation belts. The payload also includes a DC magnetometer. Besides the two scientific instruments, each payload includes solar panels generating 6 W and an onboard battery for power, a number of sensors to monitor the operation of the payload, a GPS receiver to track the position and altitude of the balloon, and an Iridium satellite link that transfer all data at a rate of 2 kps.\n\nBARREL is the first NASA Living with a Star, LWS, Geospace Mission of Opportunity, MO.

        "Description": "The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is a five-satellite Explorer mission whose primary objective is to understand the onset and macroscale evolution of magnetospheric substorms. Most importantly, THEMIS will find out which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset: (a) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current; or, (b) that current's interaction with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from lobe flux annihilation at ~25Re. Three inner probes at ~10Re will monitor current disruption onset, while two outer probes, at 20 and 30Re respectively, will remotely monitor plasma acceleration due to lobe flux dissipation. The five small satellites were launched together on a Delta II rocket and they carry identical sets of instruments including an electric field instrument (EFI), a flux gate magnetometer (FGM), a search coil magnetometer (SCM), a electro-static analyzer, and solid state telescopes (SST). The mission consists of several phases. In the first phase, the spacecraft will all orbit as a tight cluster in the same orbital plane with apogee at 15.4 Earth radii (RE). In the second phase, also called the Dawn Phase, the satellites will be placed in their orbits and during this time their apogees will be on the dawn side of the magnetosphere. During the third phase (also known as the Tail Science Phase) the apogees will be in the magnetotail. The fourth phase is called the Dusk Phase or Radiation Belt Science Phase, with all apogees on the dusk side. In the fifth and final phase, the apogees will shift to the sunward side (Dayside Science Phase).\n\nAll five satellites will have similar perigee altitudes (1.16-1.5 Re) but varying apogee altitudes (P1: ~30 RE, P2: ~20 RE, P3 & P4: ~12 RE, P5: ~10RE) with corresponding orbital periods of ~4, 2, and 1 days, respectively. This results in multi-point magnetic conjunctions. Every four days the satellites will line up along the Earth's magnetic tail with magnetic foot points in the North American sector, allowing the tracking of disturbances through different geospace regions from tail to ground.\n\nThe satellite data will be combined with observations of the aurora from a network of 20 ground observatories (all sky imagers, magnetometers) across the North American continent. In addition to its primary goal, THEMIS will answer critical questions in radiation belt physics and solar wind - magnetosphere energy coupling. THEMIS is complementary to MMS in terms of the temporal and spatial scales of the phenomena observed by these two constellation missions. THEMIS's focus is macroscale, whereas MMS will observe micro/meso scale features."

Secondary experiments consisted of a space environment monitor (SEM) and a data collection and platform location system (DCPLS). A search and rescue satellite aided tracking (SARSAT) system was also included on NOAA 8. The satellite was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it was capable of maintaining an earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 deg with a motion rate of less than 0.035 deg/s. Although designed for a 2-year life span, NOAA 8 experienced a premature failure in June 1984."

NOAA-J was in a morning equator-crossing orbit and was intended to replace the NOAA 12 (NOAA-D) as the prime morning spacecraft. The goal of the NOAA/NESS polar orbiting program was to provide output products used in meteorological prediction and warning, oceanographic and hydrologic services, and space environment monitoring. The polar orbiting system complemented the NOAA/NESS geostationary meteorological satellite program (GOES). The NOAA-J Advanced TIROS-N spacecraft was based on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5D spacecraft and was a modified version of the TIROS-N spacecraft (NOAA 1-5). The spacecraft structure consisted of four components: (1) the Reaction System Support (RSS); (2) the Equipment Support Module (ESM), which has been expanded from the TIROS-N design; (3) the Instrument Mounting Platform (IMP); and (4) the Solar Array (SA). All of the instruments were located on the ESM and the IMP. The spacecraft power was provided by a direct energy transfer system from the single solar array which was comprised of eight panels of solar cells. The power system for the ATN had been upgraded from the previous TIROS-N design. The in-orbit Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADACS) provided three-axis pointing control by controlling torque in three mutually orthogonal momentum wheels with input from the Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA) for pitch, roll, and yaw updates. The ADACS controlled the spacecraft attitude so that orientation of the three axes was maintained to within +/- 0.2 degrees and pitch, roll, and yaw to within 0.1 degree. The ADACS consisted of the Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA), the Sun Sensor Assembly (SSA), four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA), two roll/yaw coils (RYC), two pitch torquing coils (PTC), four gyros, and computer software for data processing. The ATN data handling subsystem, which was only slightly changed from the TIROS-N design to accomodate the additional instruments, consisted of the TIROS Information Processor (TIP) for low data rate instruments, the Manipulated Information Rate Processor (MIRP) for high data rate AVHRR, digital tape recorders (DTR), and a cross strap Unit (XSU). The NOAA-J instrument complement consisted of (1) the 5-channel Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/2 (AVHRR/2); (2) the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), which consists of the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/2); (3) the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking System (SARSAT); (4) the Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which consisted of the Total Energy Detector (TED) and the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED); (5) the French/CNES-provided ARGOS Data Collection and Location System (DCS); and (6) the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detection System (RAIDS), an experimental USAF test instrument. Most instruments became inoperational by February 2001. Only the omni-directional energetic ion detector remains operational as of January 2003."

Launched by the Titan II rocket from Vandenberg AFB, NOAA-K replaced the decommissioned NOAA 12 in an afternoon equator-crossing orbit. It provided support to environmental monitoring by complementing the NOAA/NESS geostationary meteorological satellite program (GOES). Instruments were flown for imaging and measurement of the Earth's atmosphere, its surface, and cloud cover, including Earth radiation, atmospheric ozone, aerosol distribution, sea surface temperature, vertical temperature and water profiles in the troposphere and stratosphere; measurement of proton and electron flux at orbit altitude, and remote platform data collection, and for SARSAT. They included: (1) an improved six-channel Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/3 (AVHRR/3); (2) an improved High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/3); (3) the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking System (S&R), which consists of the Search and Rescue Repeater (SARR) and the Search and Rescue Processor (SARP-2); (4) the French/CNES-provided improved ARGOS Data Collection System (DCS-2); and (5) the Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSUs), which replaced the previous MSU and SSU instruments to become the first in the NOAA series to support dedicated microwave measurements of temperature, moisture, surface and hydrological studies in cloudy regions where visible and infrared instruments have decreased capability.

The polar orbiting system complements the NOAA/NESS geostationary meteorological satellite program (GOES).\nThe NOAA 18 Advanced TIROS-N spacecraft is based on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5D spacecraft and is a modified version of the ATN spacecraft (NOAA 6-11, I-J) to accomodate the new instrumentation, supporting antennas and electrical subsystems. The spacecraft structure consists of four components: (1) the Reaction System Support (RSS); (2) the Equipment Support Module (ESM); (3) the Instrument Mounting Platform (IMP); and (4) the Solar Array (SA). All of the instruments are located on the ESM and the IMP. The spacecraft power is provided by a direct energy transfer system from the single solar array which is comprised of eight panels of solar cells. The in-orbit Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADACS) provides three-axis pointing control by controlling torque in three mutually orthogonal momentum wheels with input from the Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA) for pitch, roll, and yaw updates. The ADACS controls the spacecraft attitude so that orientation of the three axes is maintained to within +/- 0.2 degrees and pitch, roll, and yaw to within 0.1 degree. The ADACS consists of the Earth Sensor Assembly (ESA), the Sun Sensor Assembly (SSA), four Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA), two roll/yaw coils (RYC), two pitch torquing coils (PTC), four gyros, and computer software for data processing. The ATN data handling subsystem, consists of the TIROS Information Processor (TIP) for low data rate instruments, the Manipulated Information Rate Processor (MIRP) for high data rate AVHRR, digital tape recorders (DTR), and a cross strap unit (XSU).\nThe NOAA 18 instrument complement consists of: (1) an improved six-channel Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/3 (AVHRR/3); (2) an improved High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/3); (3) the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking System (S&R), which consists of the Search and Rescure Repeater (SARR) and the Search and Rescue Processor (SARP-2); (4) the French/CNES-provided improved ARGOS Data Collection System (DCS-2); (5) the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectral radiometer (SBUV/2); and (6) the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), which consists of three separate modules, A1, A2, and B to replace the previous MSU and SSU instruments.\n"

        "Description": "NOAA 5 was one in a series of improved TIROS-M type satellites launched with new meteorological sensors on board to expand the operational capacity of the ITOS (NOAA) system. The primary objectives of the NOAA 5 (ITOS-H) meteorological satellite were to provide global daytime and nighttime direct readout cloudcover data on a daily basis. The sun-synchronous spacecraft was capable of supplying global atmospheric temperature soundings and very high resolution infrared cloudcover data of selected areas in either a direct readout or a tape recorder mode. A secondary objective was to obtain global solar proton density data on a routine daily basis. The primary sensors consisted of a very high resolution radiometer (VHRR), a vertical temperature profile radiometer (VTPR), and a scanning radiometer (SR). The VHRR, VTPR, and SR were mounted on the satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed vertically earthward. The nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 x 1 x 1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar panels that were folded during launch and deployed after orbit was achieved. Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and was covered with 3420 solar cells, each measuring 2 x 2 cm. The ITOS dynamics and attitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation through gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite design. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by taking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so that the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit provided the desired 'earth looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in attitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by varying the speed of the momentum flywheel. The satellite was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit with equatorial crossing of the ascending node near 0830 A.M. local time."

        "Description": "NOAA 7 was an operational meteorological satellite for use in the National Operational Environmental Satellite System (NOESS) and for the support of the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) during 1978-84. The satellite design provided an economical and stable sun-synchronous platform for advanced operational instruments to measure the earth's atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space environment. Primary sensors included an advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and a TIROS operational vertical sounder (TOVS). Secondary experiments consisted of a space environment monitor (SEM) and a data collection and platform location system (DCPLS). A contamination monitor was provided by USAF to assess contamination sources, levels, and effects for consideration on future spacecraft. The satellite was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it was capable of maintaining an earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 deg with a motion rate of less than 0.035 deg/s.

In early 1984, only one to two NOAA 6 passes were taken per day due to priorities for NOAA 7 and 8 data. However, when NOAA 8 failed in late June 1984, NOAA 6 was returned to full operational status to continue to provide morning orbit operational data."
